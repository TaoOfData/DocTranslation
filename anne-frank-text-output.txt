Sunday, 14 June, 1942
Friday 12 June I was already awake at 6 o'clock and that is very understandable, since it was my birthday. But at 6 o'clock I was still not allowed to get up, so I had to restrain my curiosity until a quarter to seven. Then it was no longer possible, I went to the dining room, where I was welcomed with cups by Moortje (the cat).
At a little after seven I went to mom and dad and then to the living room, to unwrap my presents. It was you who I got to see in the first place, which is perhaps one of my greatest gifts. Then a bunch of roses, a plant, two branches of Pentecostal roses, those were flora's children that morning, who were standing on my table, but there was much more to come.
I got a lot from mom and dad and also by our many acquaintances I am very spoiled. For example, I received the Camera Obscura, a board game, lots of candy, chocolate, a puzzle, a brooch, Dutch Sagas and Legends by Joseph Cohen, Daisy's Bergvacantie, a single book, and some money, so that I can buy myself Myths of Greece and Rome, jn!
Then Lies came to get me and we went to school. During the break I treated teachers and students to butter cookies and then we had to go back to work.
Now I have to stop. That's it, I think you're so much!
Monday, 15 June, 1942
Sunday afternoon I had my birthday party. We had an lm, The Lighthouse Keeper with Rin-tin-tin, which was very popular with my classmates. We had a lot of fun and it was very cozy. There were a lot of boys and girls. Mother still wants to know who I would like to marry later. She can never suspect that it is Peter Wessel, because at the time I talked her out of her head without blinking an eye. I have been friends with Lies Goosens and Sanne Houtman for years, they were my best friends. In the meantime I met Jopie de Waal at the Jewish Lyceum. We spend a lot of time together and she is now my best friend. Lies is now more with another girl together and Sanne is at another school and has friends there.
Saturday, 20 June, 1942
I didn't write for a few days, because I first had to think carefully about the whole diary idea. It is a very peculiar sensation for someone like me to write in a diary. Not only that I have never written before, but it seems to me that later neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the revelations of a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl. But yes, actually that does not matter, I feel like writing and much more to thoroughly and completely vent my heart about all kinds of things.
'Paper is more patient than people', this saying came to mind when, on one of my slightly melancholic days, I sat bored with my head on my hands and did not know whether to go out or stay at home, and thus ended up worrying in the same place. Yes, indeed, paper is patient, and since I have no intention of ever having anyone read that cash-in notebook, which bears the broad name of "diary," unless I get a friend sometime in my life who is then "the" boyfriend or girlfriend, probably no one cares. Now I'm at the point where the whole diary idea started: I don't have a girlfriend.
To be even clearer, an explanation must follow, for no one can understand that a thirteen-year-old girl is all alone in the world; that is also not true: I have dear parents and a sister of 16, I have counted everything together at least 30 acquaintances and what you call friends, - I have a procession of worshippers, who look me in the eye and if there is no other way, try to catch a glimpse of me with a broken pocket mirror in class. I have family, dear aunts and uncles, a good home, no, apparently I lack nothing, except 'the' girlfriend. I can't do anything with any of my acquaintances other than have fun, I can never get around to talking about anything other than everyday things. Because becoming more intimate is not possible, and that's where the knot is. Maybe that lack of confidentiality lies with me; in any case, the fact is there and unfortunately it cannot be eliminated.
That's why this diary. In order to increase the idea of a long-awaited girlfriend in my imagination, I don't just want to put the facts in this diary like everyone else, but want this diary to be the girlfriend herself and that friend is called Kitty.
Since no one would understand any of my stories about Kitty, if I come into the house with the door like that, I have to briefly reflect my life history, although I do not like it.
My father didn't marry my mother, who was 25, until he was 36. My sister Margot was born in 1926 in Frankfurt a/M., on June 12, 1929 I followed and since we are full-blooded Jews, we emigrated to the Netherlands in 1933, where my father was appointed director of the Travies N.V.. This is in close relation to the rma Kolen & Co. in the same building, of which father is a fellow member.
Our lives went with the necessary excitement, as the remaining family was not spared by Hitler's Jewish laws. In 1938 after the progroms, my two uncles, brothers of my mother fled and ended up safely in U.S.A. My old grandmother came to us, she was 73 years old at the time. After May 1940 things went downhill with the good times: first the war, the capitulation, entry of the Germans, after which the misery for us Jews began. Jewish law followed Jewish law.
Jews must wear a Star of David. Jews have to hand over their etchings. Jews are not allowed on the tram, Jews are no longer allowed to drive cars. Jews are only allowed to shop from 3-5 hours and only in Jewish shops, where 'Jewish local' is written on it. Jews are not allowed to be on the street from 8 o'clock in the evening, nor to sit in their garden, nor with acquaintances. Jews are not allowed to be in theaters, cinemas or other places of entertainment, Jews are not allowed to practice any sports in public, they are not allowed to enter a swimming pool, tennis court, hockey field or other sports place. Jews are also not allowed to come to Christians' homes. Jews must go to Jewish schools and many more such restrictions.
So our life went on and we were not allowed to do this and that. Jopie always said to me: 'I don't dare to do anything anymore, because I'm afraid it's not allowed'. So our freedom was severely curtailed, but it can still be endured.
Grandma died in January 1942; no one knows how much I think of her and still love her.
Already in 1934 I entered the kindergarten of the Montessori school and stayed at this school. In 6B I came to the director, Mrs. K., rightly so; we said a heart-wrenching goodbye at the end of the school year and both cried. In 1941, like my sister Margot, I was transferred to the Jewish Lyceum, she in the 4th and I in the 1st class.
Our family of four is still doing well and that's how I arrived at the current date.

Dear Kitty,
Then I'll start right away; it is now so nice and quiet, father and mother are out and Margot has gone ping-ponging with some young people at a friend's house.
I've also been doing a lot of ping-ponging lately. Since we ping-pong players especially like ice cream in the summer and make ping-pong warm, such a game usually ends in a trip to the nearest ice cream shops, which are allowed for Jews, namely Delphi or Oasis. We no longer look for wallets or money; at the Oasis it is usually so busy that among all the people there is always some benevolent gentlemen of our extensive circle of acquaintances or some admirer, who offer us more ice cream than we can eat in a week.
I think you'll be a little surprised that, as young as I am, I talk about worshippers. Unfortunately, this problem seems to be unavoidable at our school. As soon as a boy asks me if he can etch home with me and then starts a conversation, I can be convinced nine times out of ten that the young man in question has the difficult habit of immediately catching fire and not letting me out of sight. After a while, that infatuation really subsides, especially because I don't care much about fiery looks and paddle on lustily. If it sometimes gets too colorful and they start talking about 'father questions', I wave my etching a bit, bag falls, the young man has to get off for the sake of decency and after having delivered the bag again, I have long since started another topic of conversation.
These are just the most innocent, of course you also have among them, who send kushandjes or try to get an arm, but then they are definitely at the wrong address. I get off and refuse to take advantage of his company, or am supposedly offended and tell him in pithy terms that he can go home.
Lo and behold, the foundation for our friendship has been laid, see you tomorrow! Your Anne.
Sunday, 21 June, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Our whole 1 B-class shivers; the reason is the planned teacher meeting. Half the class is betting on staying seated or passing. Miep de Jong and I smile at our two neighbors Wim and Jacques, who have bet their entire holiday capital against each other. 'You pass', 'Nietes', 'Welles', from early in the morning until late at night, even Miep's pleading looks for silence and my angry outbursts cannot bring those two to calm down.
I think a quarter of the whole class had to stay seated, such owls are in it, but teachers are the craziest people there are, maybe now, by exception, they are now, in an exceptional way, to the right side.
For my girlfriends and myself I am not so afraid, we will roll through it. Only in mathematics am I insecure. And n, wait and see. Until then, we encourage each other.
I get along quite well with all my teachers and teachers, there are nine in number, seven of which are male and two female. Mr. Kepler, the old maths teacher, was very angry with me for a while, because I chatted so much: admonition followed admonition, until I got punishment work. Making an essay with the subject 'A chatterbox'. A chatterbox! What can you write about that now? But that was of later concern and I put my agenda in my bag after registration and tried to keep calm.
In the evening, at home, when all my other homework was finished, my eye fell on the note of the essay. With the end of my fountain pen in my mouth, I started thinking about the subject; everyone can just write as far apart as possible, but to find conclusive evidence for the necessity of talking, that was the art. I thought and thought, then suddenly I had an idea, I filled my 3 given sides and was satisfied. As arguments I had put forward, that talking is feminine, that I would do my best to temper it a bit, but I would never honor it, because my mother talked as much as I did, if not more and that there is simply little to do about inherited qualities.
Mr. Kepler laughed a lot at my arguments, but when I continued my talking hour in the next lesson, the second essay also followed. This time it had to be an 'incorrigible chatterbox'. This was also handed in and Kepler had two lessons to complain about. In the third lesson, however, it became too colorful for him again. 'Anne, as a punishment for talking, an essay on the subject 'Kwek, kwek, kwek, said Miss Snaterbek'. The class estimated. I had to laugh along, although my ingenuity in the field of chatter was exhausted. I had to find something else, very original. Chance came to my rescue, my friend Sanne, good poetess, offered her help to hand in the essay from beginning to end in rhyme. I cheered. Kepler wanted to fool me with this nonsensical subject, I would make fun of him triple with my poem.
The poem came off and was beautiful. It dealt with a mother duck and a father swan, with three small ducklings, which were bitten to death by the father because of too much chatter. Kepler understood the joke well, he read the poem with comments in class and in several other classes as well.
Since then I was allowed to talk and never got punished again, on the contrary, Kepler now always makes jokes.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 24 June, 1942
Dear Kitty,
It's scorching hot, everyone puffs and bakes and in that heat I have to walk everything. Right away
I only see how a tram is, especially an open one, but that pleasure is no longer reserved for us Jews, for us the leg car is good enough. Yesterday I had to go to the Jan Luykenstraat to the dentist at noon. It is a long way from our school in the Stadstimmertuinen; at school I almost fell asleep in the afternoon. Fortunately, people automatically offer you something to drink, the dentist's sister is truly a warm-hearted person.
The only thing we are allowed on is the ferry. A small boat sails over the Josef Israëlskade, of which the ferryman immediately took us, when we asked him to transfer us. It is not the fault of the Dutch that we Jews are so miserable.
I wish I didn't have to go to school, my etching was stolen in the Easter vacancy and mother's etching was given to my father in christian people's custody. But fortunately the holiday is approaching with rapid steps, another week and the suffering has been suffered.
Yesterday morning something nice happened to me. I passed the bicycle shed when someone called me. I looked back and saw a nice boy standing behind me, whom I had met the night before with Eva, an acquaintance. He came a little shyly closer and introduced himself as Harry Goldberg. I was a bit surprised and didn't know what he wanted, but that soon became apparent. Harry wanted to take advantage of my company and take me to school. 'If you have to go in the same direction, I'll go with you', I replied and that's how we went together. Harry is already 16 and knows all kinds of things to tell about. This morning he waited for me again and in the future it will stay that way.
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 30 June, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Until today, I couldn't find time to write again. Thursday I was with acquaintances all afternoon, Friday we had visitors and so it went on until today. Harry and I got to know each other well during that week, he told me a lot about his life; he came here to the Netherlands without his parents with his grandparents. His parents are in Belgium.
Harry had a girl, Fanny, I know her as an example of softness and dullness. Since he met me, Harry has discovered that he is asleep at Fanny's side. So I'm that kind of wake-up device, a person never knows what he will be used for again.
Saturday night Jopie slept with me, but Sunday afternoon she was with Lies and I was bored to death. Harry was supposed to come to me in the evening, but at six he called. I went to the phone, then he said, "Here's Harry Goldberg, can I please speak to Anne?"
'Yes, Harry, here's Anne'.
'Hi Anne, how are you?'
'All right, thank you'.
"I regret to tell you that I can't come to you tonight, but I can't
would you like to speak now; is it good that I'll be at your door in ten minutes?"
'Yes, that's good, well that's it!!!'
'That's it, I'll come immediately'.
Horn down.
I quickly started dressing up and dressed up my hair a bit. When I
I nervously hang out of the window. Finally he got there. Miraculously, I didn't immediately go down the stairs, but waited quietly for him to call. I went downstairs and he immediately fell into the house with the door.
'Say Anne, my grandmother thinks you are too young to deal with regularly and she says that I should go to the Leurs, but you may know that I don't hang out with Fanny anymore!'
'No, why, did you have a fight?'
'No, on the contrary, I told Fanny that we didn't get along well and that we should therefore no longer get along, but that Fanny was still very welcome with us, and that I hoped that I was also with her. I thought Fanny was wandering around with another boy and treated her accordingly. But that wasn't true at all, and now my uncle told me to apologize to Fanny, but of course I didn't want to and that's why I broke up with him. But that was just one of the many reasons. My grandmother wants me to go to Fanny, and not to you, but I don't think about that; old people sometimes have very old-fashioned concepts and I can't focus on that. I do need my grandparents, but in a way they need me too.
Now from now on I always have Wednesday evenings off, because I go to wood arrows for my grandparents, but in reality I go to such a club of the Zionist movement. I'm not allowed to do that, because my grandparents are very much against Zionism. I'm not fanatical about it either, but I do feel something for it and I'm interested in it. But lately it's also such a mess there, that I plan to go out and that's why Wednesday night is the last night I go there. Then I can deal with you on Wednesday evening, Saturday afternoon, Saturday evening, Sunday afternoon and maybe even more often.'
"But if your grandparents don't want it now, you shouldn't do it behind their backs!"
'Love simply cannot be forced'.
Then we passed the bookstore on the corner and there was Peter Wessel with two more boys; it's the first time in a long time that he greeted me again and I really enjoyed it.
Harry and I were walking in blocks and the end of the song was an agreement that I would be in Harry's doorstep the next night at five minutes to seven.
Your Anne.
Friday, 3 July 1942
Dear Kitty,
Yesterday Harry was at our house to meet my parents. I had gotten cake and candy, tea and cookies, everything was there, but neither Harry nor I felt like sitting next to each other on a chair, we went for a walk and only at 10 past 8 I was delivered home. Father was very angry, didn't think it was a way that I was home late, because it is dangerous for Jews to be outside for 8 hours and I had to promise to be inside at 10 minutes before eight in the future.
Tomorrow I was asked to visit him. My friend Jopie always teases me with Harry. I'm not in love, oh no, I'm allowed to have friends, nobody sees anything in it, that I have a boyfriend or, as mother puts it, a cavalier.
Eva told me that Harry was with her one night and she asked him, "Who do you like better, Fanny or Anne?" Then he said, "That's none of your business." But when he went out the door, (they hadn't chatted together all evening) he said: 'Well, Anne, today, and don't tell anyone'. Floep, he went out the door.
You can tell from everything that Harry is now in love with me, and I like that for variety. Margot would say: 'Harry is a very suitable kid', and I think that is even more so than that. Mother is also very famous to him, a handsome boy (of face then), a polite boy and a nice boy; I'm glad harry is so popular with all the housemates. He also likes them. But he thinks my girlfriends are very childish and he's right about that.
Your Anne.
Sunday morning, 5 July 1942
Dear Kitty,
The promotion Friday in the Jewish Theatre went according to plan. My report is not that bad at all, I have one failing grade, one five for algebra, two sixes, all sevens and two eights. At home they were happy, but my parents are very different from other parents in terms of numbers. They never care about good or bad reports and only pay attention to whether I am healthy, not too cheeky and having fun; if these things are in order, everything else will come naturally. I am the opposite, I do not want to be a bad student, I was conditionally accepted at the Lyceum, because I should have stayed in the seventh grade of the 6th Montessori school. But when all jewish children had to go to Jewish schools, the director conditionally took me and Lies, after some back and forth, on parole. And I don't want to betray his trust. My sister Margot also has her report, brilliant as usual. If laude existed with us, she would certainly have passed with praise, such a handsome sphere!
Father has been at home a lot lately, he has nothing to look for in the business anymore; it must be to feel so superfluous now. Mr. Koophuis has taken over the Travies and Mr. Kraler the rma Kolen & Co. When we walked around our square together a few days ago, father started talking about going into hiding. He talked about how it will be very difficult for us to live completely separate from the world. I asked him why he was talking about that now. "Yes, Anne," he said, "you know we've been bringing clothes, food and furniture to other people for over a year. We do not want to let our goods fall into the hands of the Germans, but even less do we want to be caught ourselves. We will therefore leave ourselves and not wait until we are brought in."
"But father, when?" I became anxious because of the seriousness with which father said this.
'Don't worry about that, we'll arrange that, enjoy your carefree life, as long as you can enjoy it'. That was it. O let the fulfillment of these gloomy words be far from it for a long time!
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 8 July 1942
Dear Kitty,
From Sunday morning to now seems like a distance of years. So much has happened that
it's as if the whole world has suddenly turned around. But Kitty, you notice that I'm still alive and that's the main thing, says father.
Yes, indeed, I am still alive, but do not ask where and how. I don't think you understand anything about me today, so I'll start by telling you what happened on Sunday afternoon.
At 3 o'clock (Harry had left for a while, to come back later) someone called at the door. I didn't hear it, as I was lazily reading in a deckchair on the porch in the sun. Moments later, Margot appeared at the kitchen door in an excited state. 'There has been a call from the S.S. for father', she whispered, 'mother has already gone to Mr. van Daan'. (Van Daan is a good acquaintance and employee in dad's business.) I was shocked, a call, everyone knows what that means; concentration camps and lonely cells I already saw looming in my mind and that is where we would let father leave. "Of course he's not going," Margot explained to me, as we sat in the room waiting for mother.
'Mother is going to Van Daan to discuss whether we will leave for our hiding place tomorrow. The Van Daans go into hiding with us, we are then seven of us'. Silence. We could no longer speak, the thought of father, who was not ill-suspecting visiting old people in the Jewish Invalide, the waiting for mother, the warmth, the tension, all that silenced us.
Suddenly there was a call again. "That's Harry," I said.
'Don't open', Margot stopped me, but that was superfluous, we heard mother and Mr. Van Daan downstairs talking to Harry, then they came in and closed the door behind them. With every bell Margot or I had to go down gently to see if it was father, other people we did not allow.
Margot and I were sent out of the room. Van Daan wanted to speak to mother alone. When Margot and I were in our bedroom, she told me that the call was not father but her. I was startled again and then started crying. Margot is sixteen; such young girls only want to let them leave. But fortunately she would not go, mother had said it herself and that is what father's words would have meant when he talked to me about going into hiding.
Going into hiding, where would we go into hiding, in the city, on land, in a house, in a hut, when, how, where...? These were questions that I was not allowed to ask, and that kept coming back again and again. Margot and I started packing the most necessary thing in a school bag. The first thing I put in was this cartonned notebook, then curls, handkerchiefs, textbooks, comb, old letters; I thought about going into hiding and put the craziest nonsense in the bag. But I don't regret it; care more about memories than dresses.
At 5 o'clock dad finally came home, we called Mr. Koophuis and asked if he could still come in the evening. Van Daan left and got Miep. From 1933, Miep became a father in the business and an intimate acquaintance, as did her new husband Henk. Miep came, took some shoes, dresses, jackets, underwear and stockings in a bag and promised to come back in the evening. After that it was quiet in our house; none of the four we wanted to eat, it was still hot and everything was very strange. We had rented our large upper room to a certain Mr. Goudsmit, a divorced man in his thirties, who seemingly had nothing to do this evening; that's why he stayed with us until 10 o'clock and couldn't get away with good words. At eleven o'clock Miep and Henk van Santen arrived. Again shoes, stockings, books and underwear disappeared in Miep's bag and Henk's deep pockets, at half past 12 they too had disappeared. I was exhausted and although I knew it would be the last night in my bed, I slept immediately and was not woken up by mother until half past six in the morning. Fortunately, the heat was slightly less than Sunday; a warm rain flowed throughout the day. All four of us dressed so thickly, as if we should spend the night in a refrigerator and that only to bring some clothes. No Jew would have dared to leave home in our condition with a suitcase full of clothes. I had 2 shirts, 3 pants, a dress, skirt, jacket, summer coat, two pairs of stockings, closed shoes, hat, scarf and more, I was already choking at home, but nobody asked about that.
Margot stuffed her school bag with textbooks, took her etching out of the garage and drove behind Miep to verts unknown to me. I still didn't know where the mysterious place of our destination would be. At half past eight we also closed the door behind us; the only one I had to say goodbye to was Moortje, my little cat, who would get a good home with the neighbors, as indicated on a note addressed to Mr. Goudsmit.
In the kitchen a pound of meat for the cat, the breakfast stuff on the table, the beds taken off, all that gave the impression as if we had left head over heels. Impressions didn't care, we wanted to leave, just get away and arrive safely, otherwise nothing.
Continued tomorrow. Your Anne.
Thursday, 9 July 1942
Dear Kitty,
So we walked through the pouring rain, father, mother and I, each with a
school and shopping bag, stuffed to the top with the most mixed things.
The workers, who went to work early, looked at us pityingly; on their faces was clearly the regret that they could not offer us any vehicle; the ostentatious yellow star spoke for itself.
It wasn't until we were on the street that mom and dad told me the whole hiding plan in bits and pieces. For months they had left the house as much of our household effects and our body as possible and now we were just so far that we wanted to voluntarily go into hiding on July 16. Because of the call, that hiding plan was brought forward ten days, so that we would have to be satisfied with less well-ordered apartments. The shelter itself would be in father's office building. That's a little hard for outsiders to understand, so I'll explain it in more detail. Father did not have many staff: Mr. Kraler, Koophuis, Miep and Elli Vossen, the 23-year-old shorthand typist, who were all aware of our arrival. In the warehouse Mr. Vossen, father of Elli and two servants, whom we had not said anything.
The building is structured as follows: ground floor is a large warehouse, which is also used as a warehouse. Next to the warehouse door is the ordinary house door, which gives access to a staircase through a connecting door (A). At the top of the stairs one reaches a half-frosted glass door, on which once in black letters was written 'office'. That's the big front office, very big, very bright, very full. During the day Elli, Miep and Mr Koophuis work there. Through a cabinet with safe, wardrobe and large pantry one arrives at the small, rather dark back room. Mr Kraler and Mr Van Daan used to sit there, now only the former. One can also reach Kraler's office from the hallway, but only through a glass door that can be opened from the inside, but not automatically from the outside.
From Kraler's office, down the long narrow corridor, past the coal shed, up four steps, the showpiece of the whole building: the private office. Posh dark furniture, linoleum and rugs on the floor, radio, fancy lamp, everything fine-fine. In addition, a large, spacious kitchen with hot water heater and two gas burners. In addition, W.C. That is the first floor.
From the lower corridor an ordinary wooden staircase leads up (B). At the top is a small portal, which is called an overflow. To the right and left of the landing are doors, the left leads to the front house with warehouse spaces, attic and front loft. On the other side of this front building, a long, hypersteile, real Dutch leg-breaking staircase runs to the second street door (C).
The right door leads to 'the Secret Annex'. No one would suspect that behind the simple, grey-painted door there are so many rooms. In front of the door is a sidewalk and then you are inside.
Right in front of the entrance door a steep staircase (E), on the left a small corridor takes you into a room, which would become the house and bedroom of the Frank family, in addition to a smaller room, bedroom and office of the two young ladies Frank. To the right of the stairs a room without a window with sink and a closed W.C. booth, again an access door to Margots and my room.
When one goes up the stairs and opens the door at the top end, one is surprised that in such an old canal house such a large, light and spacious room exists. In this room is a gas stove (we owe that to the fact that it served as a laboratory until now) and a sink. This now is the kitchen and also the bedroom for the married couple Van Daan, as well as common living room, dining room and office. A very small walk-through room will be Peter van Daan's apartment. Then, just like before, an attic and loft. Here, I introduced you to our whole, jne Secret Annex.
Your Anne.
Friday, 10 July 1942
Dear Kitty,
It is very likely that I will give you my long-winded house description.
bored, but still I think it is necessary that you know where I ended up. Now the continuation of my story, because that wasn't finished yet, you know. On the
When we arrived at Prinsengracht, Miep quickly took us upstairs into the Secret Annex. She closed the door behind us and we were alone. Margot had arrived much faster with the etching and was already waiting for us. Our living room and all the other rooms were so full of clutter that it is indescribable. All the carton boxes, which had been sent to the office in the course of the preceding months, were on the floor and on the beds. The small room was filled to the ceiling with bedding. If we wanted to sleep on properly made beds in the evening, we had to get going right away and clean things up. Mother and Margot were unable to move a member, they lay on the bare beds, were tired, miserable and I don't know what else. But father and I, the two cleaners in the family, wanted to start immediately.
We unpacked boxes, cabinets, hammered and cleaned up all day long, until we fell into the clean beds in the evening exhausted. We hadn't had hot food all day, but that didn't bother us; mother and Margot were too tired and too stressed to eat, father and I had too much work.
Tuesday morning we started there, where we left off on Monday. Elli and Miep got the groceries on our food vouchers, father corrected the insufficient blackout, we scrubbed the kitchen floor and were again busy from morning to evening. Time to think about the big change that had come in my life, I hardly had until Wednesday. Then, for the first time since our arrival in the Secret Annex, I found an opportunity to share the events with you and at the same time to realize what had actually happened to me and what would happen next.
Your Anne.
Saturday, 11 July, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Father, mother and Margot still can't stand the sound of the
Westertoren clock gets used to, which says every fifteen minutes what time it is. I did, I found it immediately jn and especially at night it is such a familiar thing. You will be interested to hear how I like it in my 'dive', well, I can only tell you that I don't know yet. I believe that I will never feel at home in this house, but I do not mean at all that I find it here, I rather feel like in a very peculiar guesthouse, where I am on holiday. Quite a crazy idea of going into hiding, but it is no different. The Secret Annex is ideal as a shelter. Although it is damp and skewed, nowhere in Amsterdam will they have set up something so comfortable for people in hiding, and maybe not even anywhere in the netherlands.
Our room was very bare with those tight walls so far; thanks to father, who had already brought my entire lmstar collection and my picture postcards in advance, I, after covering the entire wall with a glue pot and brush, made one picture of the room. As a result, it looks much happier and when the Van Daans come, we will make some wall cabinets and other nice trash with the wood that is in the attic.
Margot and mother have recovered a little bit. Yesterday mother wanted to cook pea soup for the first time, but when she was talking downstairs, she forgot about the soup, which burned so much that the peas, coal black, could no longer be removed from the pan.
Mr. Koophuis brought the Book for Youth for me. Last night the four of us went to the private office and turned on the English radio. I was so terrified that someone might hear that, that I literally begged father to go upstairs with me. Mother understood my fear and went along. In other things, too, we are very afraid that the neighbors might hear or see us. Immediately the first day we sewed the curtains. Actually, one should not speak of curtains, because they are only loose light rags, totally different in shape, quality and motif, that father and I sewed together very incompetently skewed. With pins, these showpieces are attached to the windows so that we never get rid of them before the end of our time in hiding.
To the right of us is a large business building, to the left a furniture workshop; staff are not in the plots after working hours, but still noises could penetrate. We have therefore forbidden Margot to cough at night, even though she has a bad cold and give her large amounts of codeine to swallow.
I am very much looking forward to the arrival of the Van Daans, which is fixed on Tuesday; it will be much cozier and also less quiet. It is the silence that makes me so nervous in the evening and at night and I would give a lot for it if one of our protectors would sleep here.
It also scares me more than I can say, that we should never go outside and I am very afraid that we will be discovered and then get the bullet. That is, of course, a less pleasant prospect.
During the day we always have to walk very softly and speak softly, because in the warehouse they are not allowed to hear us. I'm just being called. Your Anne.
Friday, 14 August 1942
Dear Kitty,
For a month I have abandoned you, but there is not much
news to tell you something fun every day. The Van Daans arrived on 13 July. We thought it would be the 14th, but since the Germans between the 13th and 16th of July were already making more and more people restless and sending calls to all sides, they thought it safer to leave a day early than a day too late. In the morning at half past 10 (we were still having breakfast) Peter, Van Daan's son of less than 16 years, a rather boring and shy lanky, from whose company not much can be expected and brought his cat (Mouschi) with him. Mrs. and Sir came half an hour later, mrs. had a large night pot in her hat box to our great pleasure. 'Without a night pot I don't feel at home anywhere', she explained and the pot was the first to get a permanent place under the sofa bed. The gentleman did not bring a po, but his collapsible tea table under his arm.
We ate together on the first day of our time together and after three days we all knew nothing more than that we had become one big family. As goes without saying, the Van Daans still had a lot to say about the week they spent in the civilized world after us. Among other things, we were very interested in what had happened to our house and to Mr Goudsmit.
Mr. Van Daan said:
'On Monday morning at 9 o'clock, Mr Goudsmit called us and asked if I could come by. I immediately went and found G. in great excitement. He let me read a note that the Frank family had left behind and wanted to take the cat to the neighbors, which I thought was very good. Mr. G. was afraid that a search would be carried out, so we walked through all the rooms, cleaned up a bit and cleaned up the table.
Suddenly I discovered a notepad on mrs.'s writing table, on which an address in Maastricht was indicated. Although I knew that mrs had left this behind on purpose, I was very surprised and horrified and urged Mr G. to burn this unlucky paper.
I insisted all this time that I knew nothing of Your disappearance, but after I saw the paper, I got a good idea. "Mr Goudsmit," I said, "now I suddenly notice what this address may refer to. I now suddenly remember that about six months ago there was a high-ranking or cier in the office, it turned out to be a good childhood acquaintance of Mr. Frank, who promised him to help him in case of emergency and who also stayed in Maastricht. I think this or cier has kept his word and will somehow bring the Franks to Belgium and from there to Switzerland. Tell this to acquaintances, who might ask about the Franks. Of course, you don't have to mention Maastricht".
And with that, I left. Most acquaintances already know this, because I have heard this statement from different sides.'
We found the story very funny, but laughed even more at the imagination of the people, when Mr. Van Daan told of other acquaintances. For example, a family had seen all four of us on the etching early in the morning and another lady knew that we had been loaded into a military car in the middle of the night.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
Our 'dive' has only now become a real hiding place. Mr. Kraler thought it was
namely better to place a cupboard in front of our entrance door (because there are many house searches for hidden etchings), but then of course a cupboard that can be turned and that then opens like a door.
Mr Vossen has made the case. In the meantime, we have informed him about the seven people in hiding and he is all helpful. If we want to go down now, we first have to bend down and then jump, because the sidewalk has disappeared. After three days we all walked with a forehead full of bumps, because everyone bumped into the low door. Now there is cloth with wood wool nailed to it. See if it helps!
I don't learn much; until September I keep a holiday for myself. After that, dad wants to teach me, because I've bitterly forgotten a lot of what I learned in school.
There is not much change in our lives here. Mr Van Daan and I are always at odds, but he loves Margot very much. Mom sometimes pretends to be a baby and I can't stand that. Other than that, things are a bit better. I still don't like Peter any better, he's an annoying boy, he lazes on his bed all day, does a little carpentry and then starts napping again. What a stupid!
It is nice warm weather outside and despite everything we make use of it as much as possible by lying on the harmonica bath in the attic, where the sun shines in through an open window.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 2 September 1942
Dear Kitty,
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan have had a bad fight, I have never experienced such a thing, because father and mother would not think of yelling at each other like that. The reason was so puny that it wasn't worth saying a word about it. But yes, everyone's meug.
It is of course very unpleasant for Peter, who must also be among them. Nor is he taken seriously by anyone, as he is terribly petty and lazy. Yesterday he was very worried, because he had been given a blue instead of a red tongue; however, this rare phenomenon disappeared as quickly as it had come. Today he walks with a scarf around his neck, as it is stiff and further the gentleman complains about spit in the back. Pains between heart, kidney and lung are not strange to him either, he is a real hypochondriac (you call it that, right?)!
Between mother and Mrs. Van Daan it doesn't butter so much; there are plenty of reasons for unpleasantness. To give a small example, I want to tell you that mrs. removed all but three of her sheets from the common linen closet. She assumes, of course, that mothers can be used well for the whole family. Will she be ugly disappointed if she notices that mother has followed the good example.
Furthermore, mrs. is very pleased that our crockery is not, but hers is in use. She is always trying to find out where we have put our plates; they are closer than she thinks, because they are in the attic in cardboard boxes, behind a lot of advertising material. During our time in hiding, the signs are unreachable and that's a good thing. Accidents always happen to me; yesterday I smashed a soup plate of Mrs.'s crockery to pieces. 'Oh!' she exclaimed furiously, 'do you ever want to be careful, this is the only thing I have left'. Mr. Van Daan has been pussycating to me lately. Leave him alone. Mom preached so miserably again this morning; I can't stand that. Our views are exactly diametrically opposed. Dad is a dot, although he is sometimes angry with me for 5 minutes.
Last week we had a small interruption in our monotonous life: it was because of a book about women, - and Peter. You should know that Margot and Peter are allowed to read almost all the books that Mr Koophuis lends us, but the adults preferred to keep this special book about a woman's subject in their own hands. That immediately stimulated Peter's curiosity. What would be forbidden in that book? He secretly took it away from his mother, while she was talking downstairs, and went to the loft with his loot. That went well for a few days. Mrs. Van Daan had known what he was doing for a long time, but did not reveal anything until mr. found out. He got angry, took the book and thought that the case would be over. However, he had counted beyond the curiosity of his son, who was in no way upset by dad's resolute actions.
Peter looked for opportunities to read this more than interesting book. In the meantime, she had inquired with mother what she thought of the matter. Mother didn't think this book was good for Margot, but in most other books she saw no harm.
'There is a big difference, Mrs Van Daan', mother said, 'between Margot and Peter, firstly Margot is a girl, and girls are always more mature than boys, secondly, Margot has already read more serious books and does not look for things that are forbidden to her, thirdly Margot is much more developed and sensible, which brings her four H.B.S. years'. She agreed, but still thought it was wrong in principle to let young children read books for adults.
In the meantime, Peter had found the right time, in which no one looked back at the book or at him. In the evening at half past 8, when the whole family was listening to the radio in the private office, he took his treasure back to the loft. At half past 9 he should have been downstairs again, but since the book was so exciting, he forgot the time and just came down the attic stairs, when his father entered the room. What followed is understandable! A tap, a slap, a jerk, the book was on the table and Peter was sitting on the loft. That's how things were when the family came to dinner. Peter stayed upstairs, no one cared about him, he had to go to bed without food. Cheerfully chatting we continued our meal, when suddenly a piercing ge penetrated us, all laid down the forks and each looked at the other with a pale and terrified face. Then we heard Peter's voice, shouting through the stovepipe: 'I'm not coming down, though'. Mr. Van Daan jumped up, his napkin fell to the ground, with a fiery red head he shouted: 'But now it's enough'. Father grabbed him by the arm, fearing bad things, and together the two gentlemen went to the attic. After much resistance and kicking, Peter ended up in his room, the door closed and we ate on. Madam wanted to leave a sandwich for her son, sir was unrelenting. 'If he doesn't immediately ask for an apology, he has to sleep on the loft'.
We protested and thought 'without food' was punishment enough. Peter might catch a cold and then no doctor could be involved.
Peter didn't ask for an excuse, he was already on the loft. Mr. Van Daan did not interfere with it anymore, but noticed in the morning that Peter's bed had been slept on. At 7 o'clock Peter was already in the attic, but was forced to come down by father's friendly words. Three days of gruff faces, stubborn silence and then everything went back to normal.
Your Anne.
Monday, September 21, 1942.
Dear Kitty,
Today I will tell you the general news of the Secret Annex. Mrs. Van Daan is insufferable. I constantly get positions from above
for my incessant chatter. There is always something else with which she teases us; now she does it in such a way that she does not want to wash the pans and if there is another tip in it, she does not do it in a glass dish, as it has been done so far, but let it spoil in the pan. At the next dishes Margot sometimes has seven dirty pans and then madame says: 'Margotje, Margotje, what a lot you have to do!'
With my father I am working on making a family tree of his family, he tells something about everyone and that interests me greatly.
Mr. Koophuis brings me a few girls' books every other week, I am enthusiastic about the Joop ter Heul series. I particularly like the whole Cissy van Marxveldt in general. I have already read a Summer Sweetness four times and I still have to laugh at the ridiculous situations.
Learning has started, I do a lot of French and pump five irregular verbs every day. Peter has taken up his English task full of sighs. Some school books have just arrived, stock notebooks, pencils, squares and labels I have brought with me from home to a large extent. I sometimes listen to the Orange station, recently Prince Bernhard spoke. Around January a child will be born to them, he said. I like, here they are amazed, that I am so Orange-minded.
A few days ago they talked about how I am still very stupid, with the result that I went to work hard the next day. I really don't feel like being in the first class at 14 or 15 years old.
Furthermore, it was discussed in the conversation that I am hardly allowed to read anything decent. Mother at the moment has Lords, wives and servants, I am not allowed to have that (Margot is), I must first be a bit more developed, like my gifted sister. Then we talked about my ignorance of philosophy, psychology and physiology, which I know nothing about. Maybe next year I'll be wiser! (I quickly looked up these difficult words in Koenen.)
I have come to the frightening conclusion that I only have one dress with long sleeves and three cardigans for the winter. Father gave me permission to knit a sweater made of white sheep's wool; the wool is not very beautiful, heat will have to outweigh it. We still have some clothes with other people, which unfortunately can only be picked up after the war, if they are still there.
When I first wrote something to you about ma'am, she just arrived. Flap! Book closed.
'Hey Anne, can't I even look?' 'No, ma'am'.
'Just the last page?' 'No, not even, ma'am'.
Of course I was shocked, because on this page she was deposited less nicely.
Your Anne.
Friday, 25 September 1942
Dear Kitty,
Last night I was once again 'visiting' upstairs at the Van Daans to get a bit
to talk. Sometimes it is cozy. Then we eat moth cookies (the drum was in a wardrobe that was 'tucked in') and drink lemonade.
The conversation was about Peter. I told them that Peter strokes my cheek so often that I found it so annoying and that I didn't like tactile boys.
However, they asked in parents' way if I could not love Peter, as he certainly loved me very much. I thought 'oh my gosh!' and said 'oh no!' Imagine!
I did say that Peter was a bit hairy and that I thought he was shy, because that is the case with all boys, who have not often dealt with girls.
I have to say that the Achterhuis shelter committee (gentlemen) is very resourceful. You have to hear what they have come up with again to show Mr. Van Dijk, chief representative of Travies, good knowledge and clandestine goods storage, a message from us! They type a letter to a drugstore in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, customer of the business, in such a way that the man must send in an enclosed note in response and return it in the enclosed envelope. On that envelope, father writes the address. When this envelope comes back from Zeeland, the incoming note is taken out and a handwritten life sign of father is put in it. This way Van Dijk can read it without getting suspicious. They have chosen Zeeland precisely because it is close to Belgium and the note can therefore easily have been smuggled across the border, with the fact that no one is allowed to go there without a special permit.
Your Anne.
Sunday, 27 September, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Had a fight with mother, for the umpteenth time in recent times; it goes between
unfortunately not very good for us, even with Margot I don't get along well. Although in our family there is never such an eruption as above, it is not always pleasant for me. The natures of Margot and mother are so strange to me, I understand my friends even better than my own mother, that's a pity!
We often talk about post-war problems, such as, for example, that one should not speak disparagingly about maids. I found this as bad as the difference between lady and miss in married women.
Madam has for the umpteenth time the bokkepruik on; she is very moody and closes more and more of her private things away. It is a pity that mother does not answer every Van Daan disappearance with a Frank disappearance.
Some people seem to find it a special pleasure to raise not only their own, but also the children of their acquaintances. The Van Daans are among those people. There is nothing to educate Margot, who is naturally the good, sweet and handsome herself, but I carry her part in naughtiness amply with me. More than once at the table, the admonishing words and cheeky answers fly back and forth. Father and mother always defend me fervently, without them I would not be able to take up the battle again and again without a glance or blush. Although they keep telling me to talk less, not interfere with anything and be more modest, I fail more than I succeed. And if father was not always so patient, I had long since given up hope of meeting the parental requirements, which are really not that high.
If I take little of a vegetable, which I do not like at all, and eat potatoes instead, Van Daan and especially mrs. can not get over that spoiledness.
'Take some vegetables, Anne, bowl', then soon follows.
'No, thank you, madam', I answer, 'I have enough potatoes'. 'Vegetables are very healthy, your mother says that herself, take something else', she insists, until father intervenes and confirms my refusal.
Then the lady sails out: 'Then you should have been at our house, at least the children were raised there, this is not an upbringing, Anne is terribly spoiled, I would never allow that, if Anne were my daughter ...'
With that, the whole stream of words always begins and ends: 'if Anne was my daughter'. Now, fortunately, I'm not.
But to come back to our parenting theme. Yesterday fell after mrss
last words into silence. Then father replied: "I think Anne was raised very well, at least she has already learned so much that she no longer answers your long sermons. As far as vegetables are concerned, I can only answer you vice versa.'
She was defeated and thorough too. That vice versa directly indicated her own tiny portion. The lady cites for her spoiledness as a reason that too many vegetables before going to bed are bad for her stool. Let her at least keep her mouth shut about me. It is so funny to see how quickly Mrs. Van Daan gets a color. I don't like it and she is secretly annoyed by that.
Your Anne.
Monday, 28 September 1942
Dear Kitty,
My letter from yesterday was far from finished, when I had to stop writing.
I can't restrain the desire to tell you another disagreement, but before I start, here's this:
I find it very strange that adult people argue so quickly, so much and about all possible trifles; until now, I always thought that bickering was a child's habit, which would wear out later. Of course, there is sometimes a reason for a 'real' quarrel, but that word teaser here is nothing but bickering. Since these kibbelarijen belong to the order of the day, I had to be used to them already; however, this is not the case and will not be the case, as long as I come up in almost every discussion (this word is used here instead of arguing). Nothing, but then nothing they leave well to me, my performance, character, manners are all judged and chatted from top to bottom and from top to bottom. And something that I was not used to at all, namely harsh words and shouting at my address, I have to swallow according to the competent side. I can't! I don't think about letting all these insults sit on me, I will show them that Anne Frank is not from yesterday, they will still look up and quickly keep their big mouths, if I make it clear to them, that they should not start my education but their upbringing first. Is that a way of acting for me! Barbaric! So far I am always perplexed by so much ill-manneredness and especially ... stupidity (Mrs Van Daan), but as soon as I get used to it - and that will be soon - I will give them their words back unvarnished, then they will talk differently!
Am I really as ill-mannered, stubborn, stubborn, indiscreet, stupid, lazy, etc. etc. as they say above? Well, well, I do know that I have many mistakes and flaws, but they exaggerate it to a very large extent.
If you ever knew, Kitty, how I sometimes cook at those name-calling taunts! And it won't be long before my pent-up anger erupts.
But now enough about this, I've bored you with my quarrels long enough and yet I can't help but let a high-interesting table discussion follow here.
Because of some theme we came to Pims (Pim - flattery name for Papa) far-reaching modesty. This is an established fact, which cannot be questioned by even the craziest people. Suddenly, because she has to involve herself in every conversation, she said: 'I am also very modest, much more modest than my husband'.
Have you ever of your life! This sentence makes her modesty very clear! Mr. Van Daan, who felt it necessary to explain that: 'then my husband' in more detail, replied very calmly: 'I do not want to be modest either, I have always found in my life that indiscreet people take it much further than modest ones'. And then turning to me: 'Don't be modest, Anne, you won't get any further with that!'
Mother fully agreed with this view. But Mrs Van Daan, as usual, had to add her word to this parenting subject. For this time, however, she turned directly to me, but to my parents with the words: 'You have a peculiar view of life to say something like that to Anne, in my youth it was different. And I'm sure that's different now, except in your modern household!" The latter referred to the modern method of mother's method of rearing, which was defended several times.
Madam was fire red with excitement, mother, on the other hand, not at all and someone who colors winds up more and more by the warming up and loses it more quickly to the other party. The non-coloring mother, who now wanted to get rid of the whole case as soon as possible, only thought briefly, before she replied: 'Mrs. Van Daan, I also think that it is much better in life to be less modest. My husband, Margot and Peter are all extremely modest. Your husband, Anne, you and I are not indiscreet, but we also do not allow ourselves to be pushed aside in everything.'
Madam: "Oh, but ma'am, I don't understand you, I am really extremely modest, how do you come to call me indiscreet?"
Mother: 'You are certainly not indiscreet, but no one would find you particularly modest'.
Madam: 'I would like to know what I am indiscreet about! If I didn't take care of myself here, someone else certainly won't do it and then I would have to starve, but that's why I'm just as modest as your husband.'
Mother could do nothing but laugh at this ridiculous self-defense,
that irritated mrs. who continued her beautiful story with a long series of beautiful German-Dutch and Dutch-German words, until the born orator was so confused in her own words that she finally lifted herself from her chair and wanted to leave the room. Then her eye fell on me. And now you should have seen something! Unfortunately, just as mrs. showed us her back, I had shaken my head with pity and irony, not on purpose, but very involuntarily, so intensely I had followed the whole flood of words. Madam returned and began to squeal, hard, German, mean and uncivilized, exactly like a fat, red fishwoman, it was a pleasure to behold. If I could have drawn, I would have preferred to draw her in this position, so funny was that small, silly, stupid person!
But one thing I know now and that is this: you only get to know people well once you have made a real argument with them. Only then can you judge their character!
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 29 September, 1942
Dear Kitty,
People in hiding experience strange things! Imagine, because we don't have a bathtub,
we wash ourselves in a wash basin and because the office (by which I always mean the entire ground floor) has hot water, all seven of us take turns trying to benefit from this great advantage.
But because all seven of us are also so very different and the issue of genantry is higher with a few than with the rest, each member of the family has chosen a separate seaside resort. Peter bathes in the kitchen, although the kitchen has a glass door. If he plans to take a bath, he visits us all separately and informs us that we are not allowed to walk past the kitchen for half an hour. He then considers this measure sufficient. Mr. bathes all the way upstairs, with him the safety of his own room outweighs the burden of carrying the hot water up the stairs. She is not going to go into the bath at all for the time being; who waits, which place is the best. Father bathes in the private office, mother in the kitchen behind a stove screen; Margot and I have chosen the front office as a plodding place. On Saturday afternoon the curtains close there, then we clean ourselves in the dark, while the one who is not next looks out the window through a crack of the curtain, and is amazed by the funny people.
Since last week I no longer like this bath and I started looking for a more comfortable interior. It was Peter who gave me an idea to put my tidbit in the spacious office- W.C. There I can sit down, light it, lock the door, drain the water myself without any strange help and be safe from indiscriminate glances. Sunday I started using my beautiful bathroom for the first time and as crazy as it sounds, I think it's better than any other place.
Last week the plumber was downstairs to move the pipes of our water supply and drain from the office W.C. to the hallway. This change has been made in view of a possible cold winter and tube freezing. The plumbing visit was anything but pleasant for us. Not only were we not allowed to run water during the day, but we were also not allowed to go to the W.C. Now it is very unnet to tell you what we have done to remedy this problem; I am not so squeamish as not to talk about such things.
Father and I have purchased an improvised po from the beginning of our hiding time, with the understanding that in the absence of a night vase we sacrificed a glass mason jar for this purpose. We put these mason jars in the room during the plumber's visit and kept our needs in them during the day. I didn't find this so creepy as that I had to sit still all day and not be allowed to talk. You can't imagine how difficult that Miss Kwek-kwek-kwek has been. On ordinary days we have to already be ravaging; not speaking and moving at all is 10 times worse. My butt was, after being flattened for three days straight, completely stiff and painful. Evening gymnastics has helped.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 1 October, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Yesterday I was very shocked. At eight o'clock suddenly became very loud.
Called. I didn't think otherwise if someone came, who, you get that. But when they all claimed that it was definitely bad boys or the post, I calmed down.
The days get very quiet here; Lewin, a small Jewish pharmacist and chemist, works for Mr. Kraler in the kitchen. He knows the whole building well and that is why we are always afraid that he will get it in his head to take a look in the former laboratory. We are as quiet as baby mice. Who would have guessed three months ago that mercury Anne should and could sit so quietly for hours!?
The 29th was Mrs. Van Daan's birthday. Although the party was not celebrated in a big way, she was still honored with flowers, small gifts and good food. Red carnations from her lord consort seems to be in the family tradition. To dwell on mrs. for a moment, I can tell you that a source of constant annoyance for me is her irt attempts with father. She strokes his cheek and hair, pulls her skirt up very high, says supposedly witty things and tries to draw Pim's attention to himself. Fortunately, Pim does not like her or like her, he does not go into those irtations. I've been quite jealous as you know, so I can't have that. Mother doesn't do that to sir either, I told her that to her face.
Peter can occasionally come out funny. At least he has one predilection, which gives rise to laughter, in common with me, and that is dressing up. He appeared in a very tight dress of mrs and I in his suit, he had a hat on and I a cap. The adults were double and we had no less arrangement.
Elli bought new skirts for Margot and me in De Bijenkorf. It is rotten rig, just like jute bags and they cost respectively ƒ 24. - and ƒ 7.50. What a difference from the past!
Another nice thing in store. Elli has ordered written stenographie lessons for Margot, Peter and me from some association. You'll see what a perfect shorthand people we are next year. In any case, I think it is very important to really learn such a secret script.
Your Anne.
Saturday, 3 October, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Yesterday there was another collision. Mother has played up terribly and all
my sins told to daddy. She started crying a lot, of course me too and I already had such a terrible headache. I finally told daddy that I love him much more than mother, he said that it will pass, but I don't believe that. I have to force myself to remain calm towards her. Daddy wish that if mother does not feel well or has a headache, I should offer to do something for her on my own, but I don't.
I am diligently learning French and am reading La belle Nivernaise. Your Anne.
Friday, 9 October, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Nothing but nasty and depressing messages I have to tell today. Our many
Jewish acquaintances are taken away from groups. The Gestapo is by no means gentle with these people, they are simply taken in cattle trucks to Westerbork, the large Jewish camp in Drente. Westerbork must be terrible; for hundreds of people 1 laundry room and there are far too few W.C.'s. The sleeping places are all mixed up. Men, women and children sleep together. As a result, one hears of far-reaching immorality, many women and girls, who stay there a little longer, are expecting.
Fleeing is impossible; most people from the camp are branded by their shaved heads and many also by their Jewish appearance.
If it is so bad in Holland, how will they live in the distant and barbaric regions where they are sent? We assume that most of them are murdered. English radio speaks of gassing. Perhaps that is the quickest method of death. I'm totally upset. Miep tells all these horror stories so poignantly and she herself is also excited. Recently, for example, there was an old, lame Jewish woman sitting at her door; she had to wait for the Gestapo, who had gone to get a car to transport her. The poor oldie was so afraid of the hard shooting at the English pilots who flew over and also of the shouting spotlights. Yet Miep did not dare to bring her inside, no one would have dared. The Germans are not economical with their punishments.
Elli is also quiet; her boy has to go to Germany. She is afraid that the kites that fly over our houses will drop their bomb load of often a million kilos on Dirk's head. Jokes of 'he won't get a million' and 'one bomb is enough' I don't think is very appropriate here. Dirk is not the only one who has to go, every day there are full trains with boys running away. On the way, when they stop at a small station, they sometimes secretly get out and try to go into hiding; that might work a small percentage.
I haven't finished my mourning song yet. Have you ever heard of hostages? They are now introducing this as the latest punishment for saboteurs. It's the most horrible thing you can imagine. Innocent prominent civilians are imprisoned to await their conviction. If someone has sabotaged and the perpetrator is not found, the Gestapo simply puts about 5 hostages against the wall. Often there are obituaries of these men in the newspaper. As a 'fatal accident', this crime is called there. Beautiful people, the Germans. And that's what I was one of them! But no, Hitler has long since rendered us stateless. And by the way, there is no greater enmity in the world than between Germans and Jews.
Your Anne.
Friday, 16 October, 1942
Dear Kitty,
I'm terribly busy. I have just translated a chapter from La belle Nivernaise
and words written down. Then a rock and three pages of French grammar. I just choke on making those sums every day. Daddy also thinks they are bad and I can almost do them even better than he can, but in fact we can't do both of them well, so we often have to bring Margot in. In shorthand, I am the furthest thing from the three of us.
Yesterday I read The Stormers. It's fun, but it doesn't make it to Joop ter Heul.
Incidentally, I think Cissy van Marxveldt writes bang. I will definitely let my children read her books as well.
Mother, Margot and I are the best buddies again, which is actually much nicer. Last night Margot and I were in my bed together, it was incredibly small, but funny. She asked if she could read my diary. I said, "Some pieces do," and then I asked about hers, so I was allowed to read that. That's when we came to the future. I asked her what she wanted to be, but she doesn't want to say that and she makes a big secret of it. I've picked up something like education; I don't know if it's good, but I suspect it is. Actually, I shouldn't be so curious!
This morning I was lying on Peter's bed, after I had chased him off first. He was furious with me, but I didn't care. He could be a bit kinder to me, because I gave him an apple as a gift last night.
I once asked Margot if she thought I was very ugly. She said that I looked funny and that I had nice eyes. Rather vague, don't you think?
Until next time. Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
My hand is still shaking, although the scare we had has already passed for two hours.
You should know that we have five Minimax devices in the house against fire hazards. We knew someone was coming to fill the appliances, but no one had warned us when the carpenter or whatever such a man's name is otherwise did indeed come.
The result was that we were not quiet at all, until I heard hammer blows outside on the landing (opposite our closet door). I immediately thought of the carpenter and warned Elli, who was eating upstairs, that she could not go down. Father and I took mail at the door to hear when the man would leave. After fifteen minutes of working, he put his hammer and other tools on our cupboard (or so we thought) and knocked on our door. We turned white, so would he have heard anything and now want to investigate this mysterious colossus? It seemed so, the beating, pulling, pushing and jerking continued. I almost fell in fear at the thought that this complete stranger could be lucky to dismantle our beautiful shelter. And I just thought I had lived the longest time, when I heard Mr. Koophuis say: 'Open it up, it's me'. Immediately we opened. The hook, with which the door cabinet is attached and which can also be removed from the outside by insiders, had started to clamp; therefore no one could have warned us of the carpenter. The man had now gone downstairs and Koophuis wanted to get Elli, but could not open the cupboard again.
I can tell you that I was not a little relieved. The man, whom I thought wanted to enter our country, had taken on ever greater forms in my imagination, in the end he looked like a giant and was such a fascist if there is no worse one.
Hey, hey, fortunately it's all over for this time.
In the meantime, we had a lot of fun on Monday. Miep and Henk spent the night with us. Margot and I had come to sleep with father and mother for one night, so that the Van Santen couple could take our place. The food tasted delicious. A small interruption was that father's lamp caused a short circuit and we suddenly sat in the dark. What to do? New stops were in the house, but they had to be used at the very back of the dark warehouse and that was not such a pleasant job in the evening. Nevertheless, the gentlemen took a chance and after 10 minutes our candle illumination could be put away again.
This morning I was up early. Henk had to leave at half past nine. After a nice breakfast, Miep went down. It poured and she was glad that she didn't have to drive to the office on the etching.
Elli will also come on a night visit next week. Your Anne.
Thursday, 29 October, 1942
Dear Kitty,
I am very worried, father is ill. He has a high fever and red rash, the
look like the measles. Imagine, we can't even get the doctor! Mother makes him sweat well, maybe that's why the fever goes down.
This morning Miep told me that Van Daan's house has been unfurnished. We haven't told her yet, she's been so nervous lately and we don't feel like hearing another jeremiad about her beautiful crockery and her jne chairs, which have stayed at home. We also had to abandon almost everything that was beautiful; what does that complaining help?
Lately I get to read some more adult books. I am now working on Eva's youth of Nico van Suchtelen. The difference between girls' novels and this I don't think is that big. However, there are also things about the sale of their bodies by women to unknown men in streets. They charge a shovel of money for it. I would be ashamed of myself in front of such a man. It also states that Eve has become a period; hey, I long for that, it seems so weighty to me.
Father has brought Goethes and Schillers dramas out of the big closet, he wants to read something to me every night. We have already started with Don Carlos.
To follow father's good example, mother put her prayer book in my hands. For my decency, I have read some prayers in German; I like it, but it doesn't tell me much. Why does she also force me to be so pious-religious?
Tomorrow the stove will turn on for the first time, we will be in the smoke. The chimney hasn't been swept in a long time, let's hope the thing pulls!
Your Anne.
Saturday, 7 November, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Mother is terribly nervous and that is always very dangerous for me. Would
it's a coincidence that mom and dad never give Margot a stand and that everything always comes down to me? Last night, for example: Margot read a book, which contained beautiful drawings; she got up, went upstairs and put the book aside to read it later. I just had nothing to do, grabbed it and looked at the records. Margot came back, saw 'her' book in my hand, drew a wrinkle in her forehead and asked for the book back. I wanted to look a little further, Margot became more and more angry, mother mingled with the words: 'Margot reads that book, so give it to her'. Father came into the room, didn't even know what it was about, saw that Margot was wrong and fell out to me: 'I would like to see you if Margot would leaf through your book!'
I immediately gave in, put the book down, and, according to them, left the room offended. I was neither offended nor angry, but sad.
It was not good to judge father without knowing the question of struggle. I would have given the book to Margot by itself and I would have done it even sooner if father and mother had not interfered in it and, as if it were the greatest injustice, had immediately taken Margot into protection.
It goes without saying that mother stands up for Margot; she and Margot always stand up for each other. I am so used to this that I have become totally indifferent to mother's positions and to Margot's prickly moods.
I love them alone because they are mothers and Margot. With father, that's a different case. When he pulls Margot ahead of Margot, approves of Margot's actions, praises Margot, and caresses Margot, it gnaws inside me, because I love dad. He is my great example, I love no one else in the whole world but father.
He is not aware that he treats Margot differently than he treats me. Margot is simply the most handsome, the sweetest, the most beautiful and the best. But I also have a bit of a right to seriousness. I was always the clown and the good guy of the family, always had to pay double for all the deeds, once with positions and once with the desperation within myself. Now that superficial preference no longer satisfies me, nor the supposedly serious conversations. I demand something from father that he is unable to give me.
I'm not jealous of Margot, never was, I don't covet her handsomeness and beauty, I'd just love to feel father's true love, not just as his child but as Anne-on-herself.
I cling to dad because he's the only one holding up my last vestige of family feeling. Father does not understand that I have to vent about mother, he does not want to talk, avoids everything that relates to mother's mistakes. And yet mother with all her flaws is the hardest on my heart. I don't know how to keep myself, can't push her sloppyness, sarcasm and hardness under her nose, but I can't always blame myself either.
I am exactly the other way around as she is in everything and that naturally clashes. I don't judge mother's character, because I can't judge that, I only look at her as a mother. For me, mother is not 'the' mother; I myself must be my mother. I have separated myself from them, I skipper alone and will see later where I end up. It's all because I see in my mind a very big example, how a mother and woman must be and find none of it in her, which I have to give the name of mother.
I always intend not to look at mother's wrong example anymore, I just want to see her good sides and what I don't find in her, look for in myself. But it does not work and then the worst thing is that neither father nor mother realize that they are failing in my life and that I condemn them for it. Could anyone ever satisfy their children completely?
Sometimes I believe that God wants to put me to the test, now and also later; I just have to get good without examples and without talking. Then I will be the strongest later.
Who else but myself will read these letters later?
Who else but myself will comfort me? Because often I need comfort, I am so
often not strong enough and falls short more than I do. I know and always try to improve, every day.
I am treated unbalanced. One day Anne is so wise and allowed to know everything and the next day I hear again that Anne is just a little stupid sheep who knows nothing about it and thinks she has learned something from books. I am no longer the baby and the caretaker child, who can also be laughed at in all her actions. I have my own ideals, ideas and plans, but I can't put them into words yet. Ah, so much rises when I am alone in the evening, also during the day when I have to endure the people who hang out my throat or who always misunderstand my intentions. That is why I always come back to my diary, which is my beginning and my end point, because Kitty is always patient, I will promise her that in spite of everything I will persevere, make my own way and swallow my tears. I would just love to see the results, or be encouraged once, by someone who loves me.
Don't judge me, but consider me someone who can feel too full.
Your Anne.
Monday, 9 November 1942
Dear Kitty,
Yesterday was Peter's birthday, he turned 16. The gifts were nice. He has
a.o. a stock market game, a shaver and a cigarette lighter. Not that he smokes that much, not at all, it's just for the elegance.
The biggest surprise came from Mr. Van Daan, when he informed us at one o'clock, that the English had landed in Tunis, Algiers, Casa Blanca and Oran. "That is the beginning of the end," they all said, but Churchill, the English Prime Minister, who had probably heard the same exclamations in England, said: "This landing is a very big fact, yet one should not think that this is the beginning of the end. Rather, I am saying that it signifies the end of the beginning.' Do you notice the difference? There is reason for optimism. Stalingrad, the Russian city they have been defending for three months now, has still not been revealed to the Germans.
To speak in the spirit of the Secret Annex, I must also write something about our food supply. You should know that in the upper department they are real gourmets. Our bread delivers a nice baker, an acquaintance of Koophuis. Of course, we don't get as much as we got at home, but it's adequate. Food cards are also purchased clandestinely. The price of it is constantly rising, from ƒ 27. - it is already ƒ 33. - become. And that only for a sheet of printed paper!
To have some shelf life in the house, outside of our 150 cans of vegetables, we bought 270 pounds of legumes. That is not all for us alone, the office has also been taken into account. The legumes hung in bags in our hallway (inside the shelter door), on hooks. Due to the heavy weight, a few seams of the bags have popped open. So we decided to put our winter stock in the attic and entrusted Peter with the lifting work.
Five of the six bags had already landed on top in one piece, and Peter was just pulling up no six, when the lower seam of the bag broke and a rain, no, a hail of kidney beans through the air and down the stairs. In the bag was about 50 pounds, so it was a noise like a judgment; downstairs they thought no differently or they got the old house with contents upside down. (Thank God there was no stranger in the house.) Peter was shocked for a moment, but laughed terribly when he saw me standing at the bottom of the stairs, like an island between the beans, so I was surrounded by the brown stuff that reached me up to the ankles. Soon we started picking, but beans are so smooth and small that they roll in all possible and impossible nooks and crannies. Every time someone climbs the stairs, he bends down to deliver a handful of beans to mrs.
I almost forgot to mention that father's illness is completely over. Your Anne.
P.S. Just comes the message through the radio, that Algiers has fallen. Morocco, Casa Blanca and Oran have been in English hands for a few days now. The wait is now on Tunis.
Tuesday, 10 November, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Great news, we want to take in an eighth person in hiding! Yes, we are
always believed that there is still room and food for an eighth person here. We were just too afraid to tax Koophuis and Kraler even more. Now, when the outside horror reports about the Jews were getting worse and worse, father once polled the two decisive persons and they thought the plan was excellent. "The danger is as great for seven as for eight," they said quite rightly.
When this was in order, we visited our circle of acquaintances in our minds to find a single person who would fit well into our diving family. It was not difficult to pick up such a person. After father had rejected all of Van Daan's relatives, our choice fell on a dentist named Albert Dussel, whose wife fortunately stays abroad. He is known as a quiet person and, judging by the superficial acquaintance, he seemed sympathetic to both Van Daan and us. Miep is also familiar with him, so that the hiding plan can be arranged by her. When he comes, Dussel has to sleep in my room instead of Margot, who gets the harmonicaabed to the army house.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 12 November, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Dussel was very happy when Miep told him that she had a hiding place for
had him. She urged him to come as soon as possible. Preferably Saturday already. That seemed somewhat questionable to him, he still had to put his go-kart library in order, help two patients and prepare the greenhouse. With this message Miep came to us this morning. We didn't like the fact that he waited any longer. All these preparations demand interpretations to many people, whom we would rather keep out. Miep will ask if it could not be arranged in such a way that Dussel arrives on Saturday.
Dussel said no, he is now coming Monday. I think it is strange that he does not immediately respond to every proposal. If he is taken on the street, he can neither put the go-kart library in order, nor make up the greenhouse, nor help the people. So why the postponement? For me, I think it's stupid that father has admitted.
Otherwise, nothing new. Your Anne.
Tuesday, 17 November 1942
Dear Kitty,
Dussel has arrived. It's all gone with him. At eleven o'clock, Miep had
told him, he had to be in a certain place in front of the post office, there a gentleman would take him. Dussel was at the agreed place just in time, Mr Koophuis, whom Dussel also knew, went to him, reported that the said gentleman could not come yet and whether he wanted to come to the office with Miep. Koophuis got on the tram, drove back to the office and Dussel walked the same road. At ten minutes before half past 12 Dussel tapped the office door. Miep had him take off his coat so that the star was invisible and took him to the private office, where Koophuis kept him busy, until the worker was gone. Using the pretext that the private office was no longer free, Miep then went upstairs with Dussel, opened the swivel box, and stepped inside before the eyes of the stunned man.
We were waiting at the Van Daans around the table with cognac and kof e the fellow diver. First Miep led him in our living room; he immediately recognized the furniture of us, but did not even remotely think of the fact that we were above his head. When Miep told him that, he almost fell in amazement. But fortunately Miep didn't let him take too long and took him upstairs.
Dussel plopped down on a chair and looked at us all speechless for a while, as if he wanted to read the truth of our faces first. Then he stuttered, "But ... aber, since you are not in Belgium? Ist der Militär nicht komen, das Auto, die vlucht is sie nicht succesful?' We explained to him the whole case, that we had deliberately scattered that story of the soldier and the car around to lead the people and the Germans, who might be looking for us, on a wrong track. Dussel was speechless again about so much ingenuity and could do nothing but look around in amazement, when he sniffed our hyper-practical and jne Secret Annex closer.
We ate together, he slept a little and then drank tea with us, ordered his little stuff, which Miep had brought with him in advance and already felt quite at home. Especially when he got his hands on the following tapped Achterhuis hiding rules (Maaksel Van Daan):

Thursday, 19 November, 1942
Dear Kitty,
As we all assumed, Dussel is a very nice person. He found
of course it is good to share the room with me, I am honestly not so pleased that a stranger is going to use my things, but you have to have something for charity and I like to make this small sacrifice. "As long as we can save someone, everything else is an afterthought," father said, and he's absolutely right about that.
Dussel immediately asked me about all kinds of things the first day he was here; for example, when the worker comes, how the bathroom times are, when one can go to the toilet. You'll laugh, but all that in a shelter isn't so easy. We are not allowed to make such a fuss during the day that they hear us downstairs and if an extra person, such as the worker, is there, we must all pay extra attention. I explained all this nicely to Dussel, but one thing surprised me and that is, that he is so very slow to understand, he asks everything twice and does not remember it yet. Maybe that will pass, and he is only so confused by the surprise.
By the way, it goes best. Dussel has told us a lot about the outside world, which we have been missing for so long now. It's sad what he knew. Countless friends and acquaintances are away with a terrible destination. Night after night, the green or grey military cars whizz by, the Germans ring at every door and ask if Jews live there too. If so, the whole family should come along immediately, if not, they will move on. No one can escape his fate if he does not go into hiding. They also often go around with lists and only call where they know that they will get a rich loot. Ransom is often paid, per capita so much. It's like the slave hunt, as they used to do. But it's not a joke, it's far too dramatic for that. I often see rows of good, innocent people walking in the dark at night with crying children, walking all the time, commanded by such a few fellows, beaten and tormented, until they almost fall down. No one is spared, old people of days, babies, pregnant women, the sick, everything, everything goes along in the journey to death.
How good do we have it here, how good and quiet.
We didn't have to worry about all this misery, as long as we weren't so afraid of all those who were so dear to us and whom we can no longer help.
I feel bad, that I am lying in a warm bed, while my dearest friends have been thrown or fallen down somewhere outside. I myself get scared when I think of all those with whom I have always felt so intimately connected and who are now at the mercy of the cruelest executioners that exist.
And all because they are Jews! Your Anne.
Friday, 20 November, 1942
Dear Kitty,
None of us know what kind of attitude to adopt. Until
so far, of the reports about the Jews, we have never received much, and we have found it best to remain cheerful as much as possible. When Miep occasionally let go of something about the terrible fate of an acquaintance, mother and Mrs. Van Daan started crying every time, so that Miep thought it was better, not to tell anything more. But Dussel was immediately bombarded with questions and the stories he told were so horrific and barbaric that it doesn't "go in one ear and out the other."
Nevertheless, if the messages have dropped a bit, we will make jokes and tease again. It doesn't help us and those out there if we remain so gloomy, if we're all at the moment. And what is the point of turning the Secret Annex into a melancholy Secret Annex?
In everything I do, I have to think of the others who are gone. And when I have to laugh at something, I stop in horror and think to myself that it is a shame that I am so cheerful. But do I have to cry all day? No, I can't and she will pass again, this gloom.
With this misery has come another, but it is of a very personal nature and sinks into nothingness with the misery of which I have just told you. Still, I can't help telling you that I've been feeling so abandoned lately.
There is too much emptiness around me. I never used to think about it that way and my friends filled my entire mind. Now I think either about unfortunate things or about myself. And at long last I have discovered that father, no matter how sweet he is, cannot replace my entire former world. But why bother you with such crazy things, I'm incredibly ungrateful, Kitty, I know, but it also often turns me when I get too much on my head and then have to think about all that other trouble!
Your Anne.
Saturday, 28 November, 1942
Dear Kitty,
We have used far too much light and now exceeded our electricity ration.
Result: extreme economy and promised cut-off, 14 days no light, nice huh! But who knows, maybe it will still run! From four o'clock or half past five it is too dark to read. We shorten our time with all kinds of crazy things. Giving up riddles, doing gym in the dark, speaking English or French, criticizing books - it all gets boring in the long run. Since last night I have invented something new and peek into the illuminated rooms of the neighbors behind with strong binoculars. During the day, our curtains should never be set aside an inch, but if it's dark, that doesn't hurt.
I never knew before that neighbors can be such interesting people, at least ours. I found a few with the meal, a family was just licking and the dentist about this had an old, anxious lady in treatment.
Mr Dussel, the man who was always said to get along very well with children and also loves all children, is emerging as the most old-fashioned educator and preacher of long series of manners.
Since I have the rare fortune (!) to be able to share my, unfortunately very close, room with the HoogEdel-raised gentleman and since I am generally considered to be the worst educated of the three young people, I have quite a lot to offer to avoid the old, often repeated positions and exhortations and to measure myself an East Indian deafness.
All this would still be up to that point, if only the gentleman wasn't such a big clicker and hadn't also picked out mother as a transfer address.
If he has just given me the wind from the front, mother does it again thinly, and so I get the wind from behind. And if I mumble very much, the lady calls me to account five minutes later and the wind blows from above.
Really, you shouldn't think that it's easy to be the uneducated center of a bedridden family in hiding. In bed at night, when I think about my many sins and attributed flaws, I am so confused by the multitude of accusations that I either laugh or cry, already to my inner mood.
Then I sleep in with the crazy feeling of wanting differently than I am or being different than I want, maybe doing differently than I want or than I am. Oh my goodness, now I'm also confusing you, excuse me, but I don't like crossing that out and throwing away paper is forbidden in times of great paper scarcity. So I can only advise you not to read the previous sentence again and especially not to delve into it, because you will not get out of it anyway!
Your Anne.
Monday, 7 December 1942
Dear Kitty,
Chanukah and St Nicholas almost coincided this year, the difference was only one day. For Chanukah we didn't make a lot of fuss, some nice things back and forth and then the candles. Since there is a lack of candles, they are only lit for ten minutes, but if the song is not missing, that is also good. Mr. Van Daan has made a chandelier out of wood, so that this is also done.
St Nicholas night, Saturday, was much more fun. Elli and Miep had made us very curious by sparring with father all the time, so that we suspected that something was in preparation.
And really, at eight o'clock we all went down the wooden stairs, through the pitch-black corridor (I shuddered and wished for myself safely upstairs again) to the cabinet. There we could light it, because this room has no windows. When that was done, father opened the big closet. "Oh, how nice," we all shouted. In the corner was a large basket decorated with Saint Nicholas paper and on top was a Pietmombakkes attached.
We quickly took the basket upstairs. There was a nice gift for each with an appropriate verse.
I got a target doll, father bookends, etc. etc. In any case, it was all nicely conceived and since all eight of us have never celebrated Sinterklaas in our lives, this premiere was well in place.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 10 December, 1942
Dear Kitty,
Mr. Van Daan comes from the sausage, meat and spice trade. In the case
he was committed to his professional knowledge. Even now he shows himself from the sausage-like side, which is not unpleasant for us.
We had ordered a lot of meat (clandestinely of course) to wecken, if we had to go through difficult times! It was a nice sight how first the meat pieces went through the meat grinder, two or three times, then all the accessories were worked through the meat mass and how the sausage was then filled by means of a spout in the intestines. We ate the bratwurst immediately in the afternoon with the sauerkraut, but the Gelderse first had to dry well and for that she was hung on a stick with two strings in the ceiling. Everyone who entered the room and caught sight of the sausages on display started laughing. It was therefore a most beautiful sight.
In the room it was a hassle of yes. Mr. Van Daan was, with mrs.'s apron in front, in his entire thickness (he seemed much thicker than he was) busy with the meat. Bloody hands, red head and the spilled apron gave him the appearance of a real butcher. She did all sorts of things at once, learning Dutch from a book, stirring the soup, looking at the meat, sighing and complaining about her broken upper chest rib. That's what happens when older ladies (!) do such crazy gymnastics exercises to get rid of their fat buttocks again!
Dussel had an inflamed eye and bit it by the stove with kamillen tea. Pim was sitting on a chair in the ray of sun that came through the window, was pushed from one side to the other, he certainly had pain at his rheumatism spot again, because he was rather crooked and with a disturbed face looking at Mr. Van Daan on his fingers. He looked like such an old and disabled deacon house man. Peter was talking around the room with his cat, mother, Margot and I were peeling potatoes, and finally none of us did our business well to look at Van Daan.
Dussel has opened his dental practice. I will jokingly tell you how the first treatment went. Mother was ironing and Mrs. Van Daan the first, who had to believe in it. She sat down on a chair in the middle of the room. Dussel began to unpack his box very weightily, asking for eau de cologne as a disinfectant and petroleum jelly as wax.
He looked into mrs's mouth, touched a tooth and a molar, with mrs cringing each time, as if she was in pain, while emitting incoherent sounds. After a lengthy examination (for mrs. at least, because it was no longer than two minutes) Dussel started to scratch out a hole. But no, there was no thought of it, madam beat wildly with her arms and legs, so that at a certain moment Dussel let go of the scratcher, which ... stuck in mrs's tooth.
Now you really had the dolls dancing! Madam beat around her, cried (as far as possible with such an instrument in your mouth), tried to get the scratch out of her mouth and pushed it even further with all that. Mr Dussel stood there with his hands in his side. The rest of the spectators laughed uncontrollably. That was mean, because I'm sure I would have screamed much harder.
After much twisting, kicking, shouting and shouting, mrs. finally had the scratching out and Mr. Dussel continued his work, as if nothing had happened.
He did this so quickly that she didn't have time to start again, but he also had as much help as never before in his life. Two assistants is not a small number, sir and I functioned well. The whole looked like a picture from the Middle Ages with the inscription 'Quack at work'.
In the meantime, however, the patient did not have much patience, she had to pay attention to 'her' soup and eat 'her'.
One thing is for sure, madam will not be treated so soon! Your Anne.
Sunday, 12 December, 1942
Dear Kitty,
I sit very comfortably in the front office looking out, through the crack of the heavy curtain. It's dim, but just light enough to write to you.
It is a very strange sight when I see the people walking, it seems as if they are all in a terrible hurry and almost trip over their own feet.
The etchers, well, that pace is not at all up to date, I can't even see what kind of individual is on the vehicle.
The people around here don't look very attractive and especially the children are too dirty to tackle with pliers. Real slum children with snot noses, I can hardly understand their language.
Yesterday afternoon Margot and I were bathing here and then I said: 'If we now lifted the children who walk past here with a fishing rod, put them in the bath, washed and adjusted them well and then let them walk again, then ...' Margot then fell in: 'Would they look as dirty and broken tomorrow as before'.
But what am I doing, there are also other things to see, cars, ships and the rain. I hear the tram and the yawning of it and have fun.
Our thoughts have as little variety as we do. They always go like a carousel of the Jews to the food and from the food to the politics. By the way, speaking of Jews, yesterday, as if it were a wonder of the world, I saw two Jews through the curtain; that was such a bad feeling, just as if I betrayed those people and now their misfortune is tempted. Just opposite is a houseboat, on which a skipper with wife and children lives, this man has a small. We only know the dog from hearing it bark and from its tail, which we can see when he walks in the gutter of the boat.
Bah, now it has started to rain and most people have gone hidden under their umbrella. I see nothing but raincoats and sometimes a hated back of my head. It is actually not necessary to see more, gradually I know the women too, blown up by the potatoes, wearing a red or green coat, in kicked-off heels and with a bag on the arm. They have a grim or a good face, according to her husband's mood.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
The Secret Annex has learned with joy that each at Christmas a quarter
pounds of butter extra. The newspaper does say half a pound, but this is only for the lucky mortals, who get their food cards from the State and not for Jews in hiding, who only buy four instead of eight clandestinely for the duration.
All eight of us are going to bake with the butter. I made cookies and two cakes this morning. It is very busy above and mother has forbidden me to learn or read before the housework is done.
Mrs. Van Daan lies in bed with her bruised rib, complains all day, lets herself be made new connections all the time and is not satisfied with anything. I will be happy when she stands on her two feet again and refurbishes herself, because one thing must be said, she is extremely industrious and neat and as long as she is in good physical and mental condition also cheerful.
As if I don't hear enough 'sst sst' during the day, because I always make too much noise, my gentleman roommate has come up with the idea of repeatedly shouting 'sst' at me at night. So, according to him, I'm not even allowed to turn. I choke on paying attention to this and call back 'sst' next time.
He makes me especially furious on Sundays, when he lights the light so early and starts doing gymnastics. It seems to me, poor teased, to take hours, because the chairs, with which my bed is extended, constantly slide back and forth under my sleepy head. After a few times violently waving his arms to finish the flexibility exercises, the gentleman starts with his toilet. The underpants hang on the hook, so first there and back again. But he forgets the tie that's on the table. So again pushing and bumping along the chairs and so back again.
But let me not stop whining about old nasty gentlemen, it does not get any better and all my means of revenge, such as screwing out the lamp, closing the door, hiding clothes, I must omit to keep the peace.
Ah, I'm getting so wise! Everything here has to be done with reason, learn to listen, keep mouth shut, help, be kind, give in and I know what else. I am afraid that I will use up my mind, which is already not very large, far too quickly and have nothing left for post-war times.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 13 January, 1943
Dear Kitty,
This morning I am disturbed with everything again and therefore could not do anything properly
finish.
Outside it is terrible. Day and night those poor people are dragged away,
with nothing but a backpack and some money. These possessions are also taken from them along the way. The families are torn apart, split into men, women and children.
Children who come home from school no longer find their parents. Women, who go shopping, find her house sealed when she returns home, her family disappeared.
The Dutch Christians are already afraid, their sons are sent to Germany, everyone is afraid.
And every night hundreds of pilots come over the Netherlands, fly to the German cities and plow down the earth with their bombs, and every hour in Russia and Africa hundreds, thousands of people fall. No one can keep himself out of it, the whole globe is at war and although the Allies are doing better, there is no end yet.
And we, we have it right, yes better than millions of others. We are still quiet and safe and supposedly eat our money. We are so selfish that we talk about 'after the war', look forward to new clothes and shoes, when in fact we had to save every penny to help the other people after the war, to save what can still be saved.
The children here walk around in a thin blouse and with clogs on their feet, no coat, no hat, no stockings and no one to help them. They have nothing in their stomach, but chew on a carrot root, walk away from their cold house to the cold street and arrive at school in an even colder class. Yes, it has even come so far with Holland that countless children on the street stop passers-by and ask for a piece of bread.
I could tell you for hours about the misery that the war brings, but that only makes me more despondent. We are left with nothing but to wait as quietly as we can for the end of this misery. Both Jews and Christians are waiting, the whole globe is waiting, and many are waiting for their deaths.
Your Anne.
Saturday, 30 January, 1943
Dear Kitty,
I'm with anger and I'm not allowed to show it. I would like to stamp feet,
screaming, mother shaking hard, crying and I know what else about the nasty words, the mocking looks, the accusations that hit me every day like arrows of a sharply stretched bow and that are so difficult to pull out of my body.
I would like to shout at mother, Margot, Van Daan, Dussel and also father: 'Leave me alone, finally let me sleep for a night without my pillow being wet with tears, my eyes burning and my head pounding. Let me go, away from everything, preferably away from the world!"
But I can't, I can't show them my despair; I cannot make them look at the wounds they inflicted on me, I would not be able to bear their pity and their good-natured ridicule, even then I would have to scream. Everyone thinks I'm silly when I talk, ridiculous when I'm silent, cheeky when I answer, cunning when I have a good idea, lazy when I'm tired, selfish when I eat a bite too much, stupid, cowardly calculating and so on and so forth. All day long I hear nothing but that I am an insufferable wicht, and although I laugh about it, pretend I don't care, I do care, I would like to ask God to give me a different nature, which does not antagonize all people.
It can't be, my nature has been given to me and I can't be bad, I feel it. I try harder to satisfy everyone than they even remotely suspect, I try to laugh upstairs, because I don't want to show them my troubles.
More than once I have hurled mother, after a row of unreasonable reproaches, at the head: 'I don't care what you say, pull your hands away from me completely, I'm a hopeless case after all'. Of course I was told that I was brutal, was ignored a bit for two days and then suddenly everything was forgotten and I was treated like everyone else.
It's impossible for me to be a one day and hurl my hatred in their face the next. I prefer to choose the golden mean, which is not gilded, and keep my mouth shut about what I think and try to become as contemptuous of them as they are towards me.
Ah, if only I could. Your Anne.
Friday, 5 February 1943
Dear Kitty,
Although I haven't written to you about the fights for a long time, there is none there
change in. Mr Dussel took the quickly forgotten disagreements tragically in the beginning, but now he is already getting used to it and is no longer trying to mediate.
Margot and Peter are not at all what you call 'young', both so boring and quiet. I'm terribly opposed to that and I'm always told: 'Margot and Peter don't do that either, just look at them'. I think that's terrible.
I will confess to you that I don't want to be like Margot at all, she is far too weak and indifferent for me, lets herself be talked down by everyone and gives in to everything. I want to be a little more solid in spirit! But I keep such theories to myself, they would laugh at me if I came up with this defense.
At the table the mood is usually tense, fortunately the eruptions are sometimes stopped by the soup eaters. The soup eaters are all, who come from the office and then get a cup of soup.
This afternoon Mr. Van Daan talked again about the fact that Margot eats so little. "Certainly to keep the slender line," he continued in a mocking tone. Mother, who always stands up for Margot, said in a loud tone: 'I can't hear that stupid chatter from you anymore'.
Madam turned fire red, sir looked in front of him and remained silent. Often we laugh at one or the other; recently, mrs. was peddling such delicious nonsense. She told from the past, how well she got along with her father and how much she irt. "And you know," she continued, "if a gentleman gets a little tactile, my father said, you have to say to him, 'Sir, I'm a Lady,' then he knows what you mean.' We estimated like a good joke.
Peter, however quiet he usually is, also gives rise to cheerfulness. He is lucky enough to love strange words, but not always know the meaning of them.
One afternoon when we could not go to the toilet because of a visit to the office, he had to go there urgently, but did not continue. To warn us now, he attached a sign to the W.C. door with: 'S.v.p.gas!' on it. Of course he wanted to put: 'Careful, gas', but found 's.v.p.' more genteel. That the meaning of 'please' is there, he had no idea.
Your Anne.
Saturday, 27 February, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Pim expects the invasion every day. Churchill has had pneumonia, he is going
slowly forward. Gandhi, the Indian freedom man, is on yet another hunger strike.
She claims to be a fatalist. But who is most afraid when they shoot? None other than Petronella.
Henk brought the pastoral writing of the bishops to the people in the church for us. It was very beautiful and upliftingly written. 'Don't sit still, Dutch people, everyone fought with their own weapons for the freedom of land, people and religion! Help, give, don't hesitate!' They just shout that from the pulpit. Would it help? Our fellow believers certainly do not.
Imagine what happened to us again. The homeowner of this plot, without informing Kraler and Koophuis, sold the house. One morning the new homeowner came to see the house with an architect.
Fortunately, Mr. Koophuis was present, who showed the gentlemen everything, except for our Secret Annex. He had supposedly forgotten the key to the connecting door at home. The new homeowner asked nothing further. As long as he doesn't come back and still wants to see the Secret Annex, because then it looks ugly to us.
Father emptied a go-kart box for Margot and me and put tickets in it. This will be the book library, because we both write down which books we have read, by whom they were written, and so on. For strange words I bought myself a separate booklet.
Mother and I have been getting along better lately, but we are never confidential. Margot is more catty than ever and dad has something he doesn't want to show up with, but is always a treasure.
New butter and margarine distribution at the table! Everyone gets his piece of liniment on his plate. In my opinion, the distribution of this by the Van Daans is very unfair. However, my parents are far too afraid of a fight to say anything about it. Too bad, I think you should always pay back such people with the same currency.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 10 March 1943
Dear Kitty,
Last night we had a short circuit, besides they puffed incessantly. I have
my fear of everything that shoots or kites has not yet been unlearned and lies in bed with father almost every night, to seek comfort there. That can be very childish now, but you had to experience it. You can no longer understand your own words, so the cannons roar. Madam, the fatalist, almost started crying and spoke in a very small voice: 'Oh, it's so unpleasant, oh they shoot so hard', that is, 'I'm so scared'.
By candlelight it didn't even seem as bad as when it was dark. I shivered as if I had a fever and begged father to make the candle again. He was unrelenting, the light was not. Suddenly, machine guns shot, which is ten times worse than cannons. Mother jumped out of bed and, to Pim's annoyance, lit the candle. Her resolute response to his grumbling was: 'Anne is not an old soldier after all'. With that basta.
Have I told you about any other fears? I do not think so. To be informed in all the Secret Annex adventures, you also need to know this. She thought she heard thieves one night in the attic, she heard real hard steps and was so scared that she woke up her husband. Just then the thieves disappeared and the noise that mr. still heard was the beating of the frightened heart of the fatalist. 'Och Putti (sir's name), they certainly brought the sausages and all our legumes. And Peter, oh would Peter still be in his bed?'
'Peter they really didn't steal, don't be afraid and let me sleep'.
But nothing came of it, mrs. did not sleep in fear anymore. A few nights later, the whole upper family was awakened by the ghost noise. Peter went to the attic with a flashlight and rrrrt, what was running away? A mass of big rats! When we knew who the thieves were, we let Mouschi sleep in the attic and the uninvited guests did not return, at least not at night.
Peter came to the loft a few evenings ago to get some old newspapers. To descend the stairs, he had to hold on tightly to the hatch. He put his hand down without looking and ... almost fell down the stairs in terror and pain. Unbeknownst to him, he had placed his hand on a large rat, which bit him hard in his arm. The blood ran through his pyjamas, when he came to us as white as a cloth and with knees buckling. No wonder, petting a big rat is not so much fun and getting another bite in the bargain is terrible.
Your Anne.
Friday, 12 March 1943
Dear Kitty,
May I introduce you: Mama Frank, champion of children! Extra butter for
the young, modern childhood problems, in everything mother stands up for the youth and always gets her way after a dose of argument.
A glass of twisted tongue is spoiled. Gala Dinner for Mouschi and Mof .
Mof is still an unknown to you, yet she has already been in the case, before we went into hiding. She is the warehouse and office cat and keeps the rats away in the warehouse. Her political name is also easy to explain. For a while the rma had two cats, one for the warehouse and one for the attic. It sometimes happened that the two met, which always resulted in big fights. The warehouseman was always the one who attacked, while the attic beast still won the victory at the end. Just like in politics. So the warehouse cat, the German or Mof, and the attic cat, the English or Tommi, was called. Tommi was later abolished and Mof serves us all for entertainment, when we go down.
We have eaten so many kidney and white beans that I can no longer see them. If I just think about it, I already get nauseous. The evening bread distribution has been completely withdrawn.
Daddy has just said that he is not good in his mood, he has such sad eyes again, the poor soul!
I'm just addicted to the book: The Knock on the Door by Ina Boudier-Bakker. The family novel is extremely well written, what is around it about war, writers or the emancipation of women, I do not think is so good and frankly it does not interest me so much.
Terrible bomb attacks on Germany. Mr Van Daan is in a bad mood, which is why there is a shortage of cigarettes. Discussions about whether or not to eat the canned vegetables have gone well for our party.
I can't wear a shoe anymore, except for high ski boots, which are very unpractictic in the house. I could only wear a pair of wicker sandals for ƒ 6.50 for a week, when they were already out of action. Maybe Miep is digging up something clandestinely. I have yet to cut father's hair. Pim claims that after the war he never takes another hairdresser again, that's how well I do my job. If only I didn't cut his ear so often!

Dear Kitty,
Turkey in the war. Great excitement. Waiting with excitement the radio messages
ready.
Your Anne.
Friday, 19 March, 1943
Dear Kitty,
The disappointment had already followed the joy in an hour and had overtaken the latter. Turkey is not yet at war, the minister there only spoke of an imminent fuss of neutrality. On Dam Square there was a newspaper vendor who shouted: 'Turkey on the side of England!' The newspapers were snatched from his hands in this way. That is how the gratifying news has also reached us.
The 500 and 1000 guilder notes are declared invalid. That's a big noose for all black traders and the like, but even more so for owners of other black money and those in hiding. If you want to exchange a thousand-guilder note, you have to explain and prove exactly what you have arrived at. Taxes can still be paid with it, the latter also expires next week.
Dussel has received a stair drill, I will soon get a serious check.
The Fuehrer of all Germans spoke for wounded soldiers. It was sad to hear. Question and answer went something like this:
'Heinrich Scheppel is my name'. "Where injured?"
'At Stalingrad'.
"What injured?"
'Two frozen feet and a joint fracture on the left arm'.
That's exactly how the radio passed on this terrible puppet theatre to us. The wounded seemed proud of their injuries, the more the better. One came from the emotion that he could reach out to the Fuehrer (if he still had it), hardly from his words.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 25 March, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Mother, father, Margot and I sat together yesterday; suddenly Peter came in and father whispered something in his ear. I heard some of 'a ton falling over in the warehouse' and 'fiddling someone at the door'. Margot had understood that too, but tried to calm me down a bit, because of course I was chalk-white and very nervous, when father immediately went out with Peter.
The three of us were now waiting. Less than two minutes later, the lady, who had listened to the radio downstairs in the private office, came upstairs. She said that Pim had asked her to turn off the radio and go upstairs gently. But how does it go, if one wants to walk very gently, then the steps of an old staircase creak double hard. Five minutes later Peter and Pim, white up to the tips of their noses, came and told us their misfortunes.
They had sat down at the bottom of the stairs and waited, first to no avail. But suddenly, yes, there they heard two loud bangs, as if two doors were slammed shut here in the house. Pim was at the top in one jump, Peter first warned Dussel, who finally landed at the top with a lot of fuss and noise. Now it went on stocking feet one floor higher to the Van Daan family. The gentleman had a bad cold and was already in bed, so we all joined his sponge and whispered our suspicions.
Every time mr. coughed hard, mrs. and I thought we were getting the convulsions of fear. That went on for so long, until one of us came up with the bright idea of giving him codeine, the cough then immediately calmed down.
Again we waited and waited, but nothing more was heard and now we all assumed that the thieves, because they had heard steps in the otherwise so quiet house, had taken the legs. Now it was bad luck, that the radio downstairs was still on England and the chairs were also neatly arranged around it. If the door were forced now and the air protection would notice this and warn the police, then very unpleasant consequences could result from the case. So Mr. Van Daan got up, put on his coat, put on a hat and went down the stairs very carefully behind father, followed by Peter, who was armed with a heavy hammer to be sure. The ladies upstairs (including Margot and I) waited anxiously until five minutes later the gentlemen upstairs appeared and told them that everything in the house was quiet.
It was agreed that we would not let water run, nor extend the W.C. But since the excitement was almost all the housemates on the stomach, you can imagine what a air prevailed there, when we had all left our message one after the other.
When there is something like that, a lot of things always come together, even now. No 1 was that the Westertoren clock did not play, and that always gave me such a reassuring feeling.
No. 2: That Mr. Vossen had left earlier the night before and we were therefore not sure whether Elli had been able to get hold of the key and perhaps forgot to close the door.
It was still evening and we were still in uncertainty, although we were a bit reassured, because from about eight o'clock, when the thief had made our house unsafe, we had not heard anything more until half past eleven. On closer inspection, it seemed very unlikely to us that a thief would have broken open a door so early in the evening, when people can still walk on the street. Moreover, one of us thought that it would be possible that the warehouse master of our neighbors was still at work, because in the excitement and with the thin walls one can easily be mistaken in the sounds and also the imagination usually plays a major role in such precarious moments.
So we went to bed, but sleep didn't want to get to everyone. Father, both as a mother and Mr. Dussel were awake a lot and I can say with a little exaggeration that I did not close an eye. This morning the gentlemen went downstairs and pulled on the outside door if she was still locked, but everything turned out to be safe.
The events, which had frightened us so much, were told to the entire staff in scents and colors. Everyone made fun of it, but afterwards it is easy to laugh at such things. Only Elli has taken us seriously.
Your Anne.
Saturday, 27 March, 1943
Dear Kitty,
The shorthand course is finished, we are now starting to practice speed.
How handsome we become! To tell you something about my day death courses (I call it that, because we do nothing but let the days pass as quickly as possible, so that the end of the hiding time is soon approaching): I love mythology and most of all the Greek and Roman Gods. Here they think they are transient tendencies, they have never heard of a fry fish with God appreciations. Well, then I'll be the first!
Mr Van Daan has a cold, or rather: he has a little throat tickling. He makes a great fuss around it. Gargling with kamillen tea, palate brushes with myrrhe tincture, dampo on the chest, nose, teeth and tongue and then a bad mood.
Rauter, some high-ranking mof, gave a speech: 'All Jews must have left the Germanic lands before 1 July. From April 1st to May 1st, the province of Utrecht will be purified (as if they were cockroaches). From 1 May to 1 June the provinces of North and South Holland'. Like a herd of sick and neglected cattle, the poor people are taken to the nonsensical slaughter sites. But let me be silent about this, I only get nightmares from my own thoughts.
A nice news is that the German branch of the labour exchange has been set on fire by sabotage. A few days later, the Civil Registry followed. Men in German police uniforms have gagged the guard posts and thus made important papers foetsjie.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 1 April, 1943
Dear Kitty,
No joke mood (see date), on the contrary, today I can safely quote the saying: 'An accident never comes alone'.
Firstly, our cheer-up Mr Koophuis had a bad stomach haemorrhage yesterday and has to stay in bed for at least three weeks. Second: Elli flu. Thirdly, Mr Vossen is going to the hospital next week. He probably has a stomach ulcer and needs surgery. And fourthly, important business discussions were under way, and all the main points had been discussed in detail with Mr Koophuis, Mr Kraler cannot be informed very well in the rush.
The expected gentlemen came, father shivered in advance about the a oop of the discussion. "If only I could be there, I'd just be downstairs," he exclaimed. 'Then lie down with your ear on the floor, the gentlemen come into the private office anyway, then you can hear everything'. Father's face cleared up and at half past eleven yesterday morning Margot and Pim (two ears hear more than one) took their position on the ground. The discussion was not ended in the morning, but in the afternoon father was unable to continue the listening campaign. He was rattled by the unusual and unpracticed attitude. I took his place at half past three, when we heard voices in the hallway. Margot kept me company, the conversation was partly so long-winded and annoying that I suddenly fell asleep on the hard, cold linoleum ground. Margot did not dare to touch me for fear that they would hear us downstairs and shouting was not possible at all. I slept for a good half hour, then woke up startled and had forgotten all about the important meeting. Fortunately, Margot had paid more attention.
Your Anne
Friday, 2 April 1943
Dear Kitty,
Ah, I have something terrible in my sin register again.
Last night I was in bed and waiting for dad to come and pray with me and then say good night, when mom came into the room, sat down on my bed and very modestly asked, "Daddy isn't coming yet, won't we even pray together?"
"No, mansa," I replied.
Mother got up, stood next to my bed, then slowly walked to the door. Suddenly she turned around and with a contorted face she said: 'I don't want to be angry, love can't be forced'. A few tears slid down her face as she went out the door.
I lay still and immediately thought it was mean of myself that I had bumped her off so roughly, but I also knew that I could not answer otherwise. I cannot hypocritically pray with her against my will. It simply didn't work.
I felt sorry for mother, a lot of pity, because for the first time in my life I noticed that my cool attitude does not leave her indifferent. I saw the sadness on her face when she talked about love, which cannot be forced. It is hard to tell the truth, and yet it is the truth that she herself has pushed me off, that she herself has dulled me for every love on her part by her unintentional remarks, her crude banter about things that are not accessible to me for jokes. Just as I cringe every time she adds her harsh words to me, so her heart cringed when she noticed that the love between us had truly disappeared.
She cried half the night and hardly slept all night. Father does not look at me and when he does it for a moment, I read in his eyes the words: 'How could you be so bad, how dare you mother do such a sorrow'.
They expect me to apologize, but this is a case for which I cannot apologize because I have said something that is true and that mother must know sooner or later. I seem and have become indifferent to mother's tears and father's gaze, because they both feel something of what I notice incessantly for the first time. I can only feel sorry for mother, who has to find her own attitude again. I remain silent and cool and will not shy away from the truth either, because the longer it is delayed, the harder it is to hear.
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 27 April, 1943
Dear Kitty,
The whole house is thundering with arguments. Mother and I, the Van Daans and Papa, mother and
madam, everything is angry with each other, nice atmosphere, isn't it? Anne's usual register of sins resurfaced on the carpet in its entirety.
Mr Vossen is already in the Binnengasthuis, Mr Koophuis is up again, the stomach bleeding was stopped more quickly than usual. He has said that the Civil Registry has been attacked even more by the fire brigade, which instead of just putting out the fire, has flooded the whole thing. Please me!
The Carlton Hotel is broken, two English pilots with a large load of incendiary bombs on board have fallen exactly on the 'Of ziersheim'. The entire corner of Vijzelstraat-Singel has burned down. The air raids on German cities are getting stronger from day to day. We don't have a night of rest anymore, I have black circles under my eyes because of the lack of sleep. Our food is miserable. Breakfast with dry bread and kof esurrogate. Dinner: spinach or lettuce for fourteen days. Potatoes of 20 cm length taste sweet and rotten. Who wants to lose weight in the Secret Annex! Upstairs they complain stone and bone, we do not find it so tragic. All men who fought or were mobilized in 1940 were called up to work as prisoners of war for the Fuehrer. Do they certainly as a precaution against the invasion!
Your Anne.
Saturday, 1 May 1943
Dear Kitty,
When I sometimes think about how we live here, I usually come to the conclusion that we have it here, in relation to the other Jews, who are not in hiding, as in paradise. Nevertheless, later, when everything is normal again, I will be amazed how we, who had it very neat at home, have sunk down so much.
Dropped in that sense of the word, as far as the manners are concerned. For example, since we have been here, we have always had one tarpaulin on our table, which is usually not among the cleanest due to the many uses. However, I often try to fix it up with a dirty dishcloth, which is more hole than cloth. Even with this, on the table, with so hard polishing, not much honor can be achieved. The Van Daans have been sleeping all winter on a piece of anel, which cannot be washed here, because the chocolate soap powder is far too scarce and, moreover, far too bad. Father walks with frayed pants and his tie also shows wear and tear. Mom's corset is today snapped off of age and is beyond repair, while Margot walks with a bust holder that is two sizes too small.
Mom and Margot have been wearing three shirts all winter and mine are so small they don't even get to my belly yet.
These are all things that can be stepped over now, yet I sometimes think with fear: 'How do we, who walk around with worn things from my underpants to my father's shaving brush, want to belong to our pre-war position again later?'
Last night I had to pick up all my belongings four times, that's how hard they puffed. Today I packed a suitcase, in which I put the most necessary flight needs. But mother rightly says: 'Where do you want to flee to?'
The whole of the Netherlands has punishment for striking in many areas. That is why a state of toppings has been proclaimed and everyone gets one less butterbon. How naughty the children are!
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 18 May, 1943
Dear Kitty,
I have been an observer of a fierce dogfight between German and English pilots. Unfortunately, a few Allies had to jump out of their burning aircraft. Our milkman, who lives in Halfweg, has seen four Canadians sitting on the side of the road, one of whom spoke fluent Dutch. He asked the milkman for a fire for a cigarette and told him that the crew of the machine had consisted of six people. The pilot had been burned and their fifth husband had been hiding somewhere. The green police came to pick up the four perfectly healthy people. How is it possible that after such a great parachute trip you still have so much presence of mind.
Although it is quite hot, we have to make our stoves every other day to burn vegetable waste and dirt. In garbage cans we can not throw anything, because we always have to take the warehouse worker into account. How light a little carelessness does not betray you!
All students, who want to graduate or continue their studies of the year, must sign on a list of the government, that they sympathize with the Germans and are in good spirits with the new order. 80 pCt has stifled it to deny its conscience and conviction, but the consequences have not failed to materialize. All students, who have not signed, have to go to Germany in a labour camp. What remains of the Dutch youth, if all in Germany have to work hard?
Because of the loud bangs, mother had closed the window last night; I was in Pim's bed. Suddenly, above our heads, mrs jumps out of her bed, as if bitten by Mouschi, immediately followed by a hard blow. It sounded like a firebomb had fallen next to my bed. I screamed, "Light, light!" Pim cut the lamp. I expected nothing but that within a few minutes the room would be in light. Nothing happened. We all rushed upstairs to see what was going on there. Mr. and Mrs. had seen a pink glow through the open window. The gentleman thought it was burning nearby and mrs thought that our house had caught fire. At the blow that followed, mrs. was already standing on her trembling legs. But nothing else happened and we crawled back into our beds.
Less than fifteen minutes had elapsed, or the shooting started again. Mrs. immediately rose to her feet and walked down the stairs to Mr. Dussel's room, to find the peace that was not available to her with her ega. Dussel received her with the words: "Come into my bed, my child!" Which made us laugh uncontrollably. The cannon fire no longer bothered us, our fear was wiped out.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
My birthday verse from dad is too good for me to remember this poem.
Since Pim mostly closes in German, Margot had to translate. Judge by the piece quoted here herself, whether Margot has not done her voluntary task well. After the usual brief summary of the annual events, the following follows:
'As the youngest of all and yet no longer small, you don't have it easy; everyone wants to be
A bit your teacher, you often to pain.
"We have experience!" - "Take it from me!" "We've done something like this before.
And know better what is possible and what is allowed".
Yes, that's how it's been for years.
Its own defects are of no weight,
That's why reprimanding is so light.
Of otherren the mistakes that count heavily,
It's hard for us, your parent couple
Always to judge very justly,
Rebuking the ancients is peculiar.
Is one together with so many berries,
Then one has to swallow all those lessons
Like you take a bittre pill.
It is done for peace will.
The months here are not wasted,
You wouldn't have wanted that either.
With learning and reading many books
Could you look for "boredom" with a light.
But even more difficult is the question:
"What should I wear? Whatever I wear
Is way too small. I don't have pants,
My shirt is like a loincloth
And then the shoes, it's not to be worn
As many ailments as teasing me"'.
Margot couldn't get a piece about the eating theme translated in rhyme and that's why I leave it out altogether. By the way, don't you like my verse? Furthermore, I am very spoiled and have received many beautiful things, including a thick book about my favorite subject: the mythology of Hellas and Rome. I can't complain about lack of sweets either, all of them have used their last stock. As Benjamin of the diving family, I am truly honored with much more than I deserve.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
A lot has happened, but I usually think that all my uninteresting chatter bores you very much and that you are happy if you do not receive so many letters. I will therefore only briefly show you the messages.
Mr Vossen did not have surgery on a stomach ulcer. When they had him on the operating table and his stomach was open, the doctors saw that he had cancer, which had already progressed so far that there was nothing left to operate on. So they closed the stomach again, then kept him in bed for three weeks and fed him well and finally sent him home. I feel very sorry for him and I think it's very bad that we can't go out on the street, otherwise I would definitely visit him often to distract him. For us it is a disaster that those good Foxes no longer keep us informed of everything that happens in the warehouse and is heard. He was our best help and support for caution, we miss him very much.
Next month it will be our turn with the radio handover. Koophuis has a clandestine Baby device at home, which we get to replace our large Philips. It is a pity that that beautiful cupboard has to be handed in, but a house where people are in hiding should under no circumstances deliberately get on the government's neck. We put the small radio upstairs. Clandestine Jews, clandestine money and clandestine buying is also possible a clandestine radio.
All people are trying to get an old device to hand it in instead of their 'courage-hold-source'. It is true, when the messages from outside get worse and worse, the radio helps with its miracle voice, that we do not lose heart by saying again and again: 'Head on, keep up good cheer, there will be other times too!'

Dear Kitty,
To come back to the parenting theme for the umpteenth time, I will tell you that I give myself a lot of effort to be helpful, kind and sweet and to do everything in such a way that the qualifying rain becomes a drizzle. It's hard to be so exemplary for people you can't stand, when you don't mean anything about it. But I really see that I can move forward with it, if I'm a little hypocritical, instead of following my old habit of telling everyone my opinion outright (although no one ever asks for my opinion or values it.).
Often I fall out of my role and can't stomach my anger at injustices, so that the boldest girl in the world is talked about for four weeks. Don't you think I'm sometimes to be pitied? It's a good thing I'm not a grumbler, because then I'd get soured and not be able to keep my good mood.
Furthermore, I decided to let shorthand shoot a bit. It took a long time. Firstly, to be able to spend even more time on my other subjects and secondly on my eyes, because that is a miserable misery. I have become very nearsighted and had to have glasses for a long time (oops, what will I look owlish), but yes, you know, people in hiding are allowed ... Yesterday the whole house talked about nothing but Anne's eyes, because mother had suggested that Mrs Koophuis should send me to the ophthalmologist. With this announcement I staggered on my legs for a moment, because that is no small thing.
On the street. Imagine: on the street! It's not to be imagined. At first I was terrified and later happy. But it was not that simple, not all the authorities that have to decide on such a step were so quick to agree. All difficulties and risks had to be put on the scales first, although Miep wanted to go out with me immediately.
I took my grey coat out of the closet, but it was so small that it looked like my youngest sister.. I am really curious what will come of it, but I do not think that the plan will go through, because in the meantime the English have landed on Sicily and father is again set up for 'a soon end'.
Elli gives Margot and me a lot of office work, we both find that weighty and it helps her a lot. Anyone can store correspondence and register a sales book, but we do it very meticulously.
Miep is exactly a pack donkey, who carries a bit. Almost every day she has picked up vegetables somewhere and brings everything in large shopping bags on the etching. It is also she who brings five library books every Saturday. We always look forward to Saturday, because that's when the books come. Just like small children, who get a gift.
Ordinary people also don't know how much books mean to us incarcerated people. Reading, learning and the radio are our things.
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 13 July 1943
Dear Kitty,
Yesterday afternoon, on father's leave, I had asked Dussel if he would please be okay (very politely) that I could also use the table in our room twice a week in the afternoon from four o'clock to half past six. From half past three to four o'clock I sit there every day, while Dussel sleeps and the room plus the table is off limits. Inside, in our general room it is much too busy in the afternoon, one cannot work there and by the way, father sometimes likes to work at the writing table in the afternoon.
So the reason was reasonable and the question only pure politeness. What do you think that the highly educated Dussel answered: 'No'. Bluntly and only 'No!' I was indignant and didn't just let myself be dismissed, so I asked him the reason for his 'no'. But I came home from a cold fair. Here's the load that followed:
'I also have to work, if I can't work in the afternoon, there's no time left for me. I have to get my pensum finished, otherwise I started it for nothing. You're not working on anything serious anyway. That mythology, what is that for work, knitting and reading is not work either. I am and will remain at that table'. My answer was: 'Mr Dussel, I do work seriously; I can't work inside in the afternoon, I kindly ask you to think about my question again!"
With these words, the offended Anne turned around, and pretended that the highly learned doctor was air. I looked with anger, found Dussel terribly rude (and he was) and very friendly to me. In the evening when I could get hold of Pim, I told him how the case had ended and discussed with him what else I should do next, because I did not want to give up the business and she also preferred to fix it up on my own. Pim pretty much told me how to handle the matter, but admonished me to wait until the next day, because of my excitement.
I ignored this last advice and waited for Dussel after washing the dishes. Pim was sitting next to us in the room and that gave me a great peace. I began: 'Mr Dussel, I do not think it was worthwhile to take a closer look at the matter with me, but I would ask you to do so anyway'. With his dearest smile, Dussel then remarked: 'I am always and at all times ready to speak about this matter, which has already been settled!'
I then continued the conversation, always interrupted by Dussel. "We agreed in the beginning, when you came here, that this room would be together for us, so if the layout was right, you would get the morning and I would get the whole afternoon! But I don't even ask that, and I think, then two afternoons a week are fair.'
Dussel jumped up like a needle. 'You don't have to talk about justice here at all. And where should I stay? I will ask Mr Van Daan if he wants to build a booth for me in the attic, then I can sit there, I can't even work quietly anywhere. A person always has a quarrel with you. If your sister Margot, who has more reason for such a question, came to me with the same request, I would not think of refusing, but you ..."
And then came the story of mythology and knitting, and Anne was offended again. However, she did not show it and let Dussel say: 'But yes, you simply cannot be talked to. You are a shameful egoist, if you can get your way, then everyone else can step aside, I have never seen such a child. But after all, I will be forced to give you your way, because otherwise I will hear later that Anne Frank failed her exam, because Mr Dussel did not want to give her the table.'
It went on and on and on, at the end such a flood that I could hardly keep up. One moment I thought, 'I'll slap him straight away, that he'll fly against the wall with his untruths', and the next moment I said to myself: 'Keep calm, that guy is not worth it, that you are so worried about him!'
Finally, Mr. Dussel was finished and went out of the room with a face that read both wrath and triumph, with his coat full of food. I ran to father and, as far as he had not followed our conversation, told the whole story. Pim decided to talk to Dussel the same evening and that's how it happened. They talked for more than half an hour. The subject of the conversation was something like this: they first talked about it, whether Anne should sit at the table, yes or no. Father said that Dussel and he had already spoken about the same subject once, but that he had then supposedly agreed with Dussel not to rule against the older one. But fairly, father hadn't found it then. Dussel thought that I was not allowed to speak, as if he were an intruder and confiscated everything, but father certainly contradicted this, because he himself had heard that I had not said a word of it. It went back and forth like this, father defending my selfishness and my 'pruts' work, Dussel always grumbling.
Dussel finally had to give in and I was given the opportunity to work undisturbed until five o'clock two afternoons a week. Dussel looked very sip, did not speak to me for two days and still had to sit at the table from five to half past six ... childish, of course.
Someone who is already 54 years old and still has such pedantic and petty habits, is made that way by nature and never learns those habits again.

Dear Kitty,
Another burglary, but now a real one!
This morning Peter went to the warehouse, as usual, at seven o'clock and immediately saw that both the warehouse and the street door were open. He reported this to Pim, who locked the radio on Germany and the door in the private office. Together they went upstairs.
The ordinary command in such cases, not turning on a tap, so do not wash, be quiet, sit ready at eight o'clock, and not to the W.C ...., was strictly followed as usual. All eight of us were happy that we slept so well at night and hadn't heard anything. It was only at half past twelve that Mr Koophuis told us that the burglars had pushed the outside door with a crowbar and forced the warehouse door. However, there was not much to steal in the warehouse and therefore the thieves tried their luck only one floor higher.
They have two money boxes, containing ƒ 40. -, blank giro and bank books and then the worst, the entire sugar allocation in vouchers of a total of 150 kg stolen.
Mr Koophuis thinks that these burglars belong to the same guild as the one who was here six weeks ago and tried to enter at all three doors. Then it hadn't worked out.
The case has caused some swell in our building, but without it the Secret Annex does not seem to be able to do it. We were happy that the typewriters and the cash register were safe in our wardrobe, because they bring them up every night.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
On Sunday, Amsterdam-Noord was heavily bombed. The devastation must be terrible. Entire streets are in ruins and it will be a long time before all the people are mined. So far, there have been 200 dead and countless wounded; the hospitals are packed. You'll hear of children searching lost in the smoldering ruins for their dead parents.
I get chills when I still think of the dull, thumping rumble in the distance, which for us was a sign of the approaching destruction.
Your Anne.
Friday, July 23, 1943.
Dear Kitty,
For the sake of kindness, I will tell you what the first wish of the eight of us is, if we can go outside again. Margot and Mr. Van Daan wish for a hot bath up to the top and want to stay in it for more than half an hour. Mrs. Van Daan prefers to eat cakes immediately, Dussel knows nothing but Lotje, his wife, mother her cup of coffee, father is going to visit Mr. Vossen first, Peter to the city and in the cinema and I would not know what to start from the bliss.
I long most for my own home, free movement and finally help with work again, so to school.
Elli offered us fruit. Costs a trifle. Grapes ƒ 5. - per kg, gooseberries ƒ 0.70 per pound. A peach ƒ 0.50, 1 kg melon ƒ 1.50. And then every night they put in the newspaper with cow letters: 'Price gouging is usury!'
Your Anne.
Monday, 26 July, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Yesterday was a very noisy day and we are still excited. You can actually ask, which day passes without excitement.
In the morning at breakfast we got the first time pre-alarm, but that can't bomb us, because it means that there are kites on the coast. After breakfast I lay down for an hour, because I had a bad headache and then went downstairs. It
was about two hours. At half past three Margot finished her office work; she hadn't caught her bowl yet or the sirens were blaring, so I went back upstairs with her. It was about time, because we were not even five minutes up, or they started shooting hard, so we stood in the hallway. And sure enough, there the house was thumping and the bombs fell.
I clamped my flight bag against me, more to have something to hold than to flee, because we can't leave anyway. If we were to flee in the extreme case, the street would be as much danger to life as a bombardment. After half an hour the flying became less, but the activity in the house increased. Peter came from his lookout in the attic, Dussel was in the front office, Mrs. felt safe in the private office, Mr. Van Daan had watched from the loft and we in the portal also spread out and I climbed the stairs, to see the smoke columns rising above the IJ that Mr. Van Daan had told me about. Soon it smelled like fire everywhere and it looked like there was thick fog outside.
Although such a big fire is not a nice sight, fortunately it was behind us again and we went into our respective activities. Evening at dinner: air raid alarm. We had good food, but the appetite disappeared with me at the sound alone. However, nothing happened and three quarters of an hour later everything was safe. The dishes were on the side: air raid alarm, shooting, an awful lot of kites. 'Oh jeminee, twice in a day, that's a lot', we all thought, but that didn't help, again it rained bombs, this time on the other side, to say the English at Schiphol. The kites dove, took off, it whizzed in the air and it was very creepy. Every moment I thought: 'Now he falls, there you go'.
I can assure you that when I went to bed at nine o'clock, I could not keep my legs straight. At the stroke of twelve I woke up: kites. Dussel was undressing, it didn't bother me, I jumped out of bed wide awake at the first shot. Two hours back with father and they flew all the time and still. Then no more shot was fired and I could go to bed. At half past three I fell asleep.
Seven hours. With a shock I sat up in bed. Van Daan was with his father. Burglars, was my first thought. 'Everything', I heard Van Daan say, I thought everything had been stolen. But no, now it was a wonderful message, as we had not heard in months, perhaps in all the war years. "Mussolini has resigned, the Emperor King of Italy has taken over the government." We cheered. After all that terrible yesterday, finally some good and ... hope. Hope in the end, hope for peace.
Kraler stopped by and told us that Fokker was severely affected. In the meantime, we had an air raid alarm again last night with overflyers and another pre-alarm. I'm just about choking on the alarms, haven't slept in and don't feel like working. But now the tension about Italy keeps us awake and the hope for the end, maybe this year ...
Your Anne.
Thursday, 29 July, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Mrs. Van Daan, Dussel and I were busy with the dishes and what almost never
prevented and would certainly notice them was that I was extremely quiet.
To avoid questions, I quickly looked for a fairly neutral subject and
thought that the book Henri van den Overkant would meet that requirement. But I had miscalculated. If I do not get mrs on my roof, it is Mr Dussel. It came down to this: Mr Dussel had particularly recommended this book to us, as an excellent copy. However, Margot and I found it anything but excellent. The boy was well drawn, but the rest ... let me rather remain silent about that. I brought something similar to the dishes on the carpet and that gave me a huge load.
"How can you understand the psyche of a man! From a child that is not so difficult (!). You are far too young for such a book, a man of twenty years could not even comprehend this.' (Why did he especially recommend Margot and me this book so much?)
Now Dussel and Mrs. Van Daan continued together:
'You know far too much about things that are not suitable for you, you were brought up completely wrong. Later, when you're older, you don't enjoy anything anymore, then you say, "I read that in books twenty years ago." You just have to hurry, if you want to get another man or fall in love, you certainly find everything disappointing. You are already completely accomplished in theory, only the practical ones, you still miss them!'
It's certainly their view of a good upbringing to always turn me so up against my parents, because that's what they often do. And to tell a girl my age nothing about 'adult' subjects is an equally excellent method. The results of such an upbringing are often all too obvious.
I could punch those two, who were standing there making fun of me, in the face at that moment. I was out of myself with anger and would really start counting the days that I got rid of 'those' people. That Mrs. Van Daan is also a copy to me! That is where one has to get his examples from, but the examples ... but then the bad ones.
She is known to be very rude, selfish, cunning, calculating and satisfied with nothing. Vanity and coquetterie are also added. She is, there is no question about that, an outspoken person. I could fill volumes about madame and who knows, maybe I'll get to that again. A nice varnish on the outside can be imposed on anyone. Madame is kind to strangers and especially to men and therefore one is mistaken, if one only knows her.
Mother thinks she is too stupid to lose a word, Margot too unimportant, Pim too ugly (literally and beautifully) and after a long journey, because I have never been biased from the beginning, I have come to the conclusion that she is all three and much more. She has so many bad qualities, why should I start with one of them?
Your Anne.
P.S. Wants to face the reader for a moment, that when this story was written, the writer had not yet cooled from her anger!
Wednesday, 4 August 1943
Dear Kitty,
You now know, after we have been Movers for more than a year, something of our lives,
but I can't fully inform you. It is everything so extensive, different from ordinary times and with ordinary people. In order to give you a closer look into our lives, I will occasionally describe a piece of an ordinary day in the future. Today I start with the evening and the night:
In the evening nine o'clock starts in the Secret Annex the hustle and bustle of going to bed starts and that is really always a lot of hustle and bustle.
Chairs are shifted, beds are knocked over, blankets folded; nothing stays where it should be during the day. I sleep on the small divan, which is less than 1.50 m long. Here, chairs must serve as an extension. A feather duster, sheets, pillows, blankets, everything is taken from Dussel's bed, where it stays during the day.
Inside one hears a terrible crackle; the bed à la harmonica by Margot. Again divan blankets and pillows, everything to make the wooden slats a little more comfortable. Upstairs it looks like it's thunderstorms, it's just mrs's bed. This is pushed by the window to give her Highness, with the pink bed jacket, something pungent in the small nose holes.
Nine o'clock: After Peter I enter the laundry room, where a thorough washing treatment follows, and it sometimes happens (only in the hot months or weeks), that a small flea floats in the washing water with it. Then brushing teeth, curling hair, treating nails, handling hydrogen wafers (serves to bleach black whiskers) and all this in less than half an hour.
Half past ten. Soon bathrobe on, soap in one, po, hairpins, pants, crawling and cotton wool in the other hand I rush out of the bathroom, usually recalled for the different hairs, which in graceful, but for the next washer not too pleasant arches disfigure the sink.
Ten o'clock: Eclipse before, good night. In the house for fifteen minutes a creak of beds and a sigh of broken feathers, then everything is quiet, if at least the upstairs neighbors do not have a bed quarrel.
Half past twelve: The bathroom door creaks. A thin streak of light falls into the room. Crackle of shoes, a big coat, even bigger than the man underneath ... Dussel returns from his night work in Kraler's office. Ten minutes of shuffling on the floor, rustling paper (that's the food to be stored) and a bed is made. Then the figure disappears again and one only hears from time to time from the W.C. a suspicious sound.
Three hours: I have to get up for a small message in the metal can under my bed, where a gummi mat has been placed underneath, for any leaks. If this is to happen, I always hold my breath, because it clatters in the van like a stream of a mountain. Then the can goes back into place and a figure in a white nightgown, which every night elicits from Margot the exclamation: 'Oh, that immoral nightgown!' gets into bed.
For about fifteen minutes, a certain person is listening to the nightly sounds. First of all, whether there might be a thief downstairs, then to the various beds, upstairs next to and in the room, from which one can usually tell how the different housemates sleep or spend the night half-awake.
The latter is certainly not pleasant, especially if it concerns a member of the family in particular Dussel. First I hear a sound as if a fish is gasping for air, this repeats itself about ten times, then with a lot of fuss the lips are moistened, alternated by small smacking sounds, followed by a prolonged back and forth in bed and changing pillows. Five minutes of complete rest and then this settlement of events repeats itself three more times, after which the dr has certainly lulled himself back to sleep for a while.
It can also happen that shots are fired at night varying between one and four o'clock. I never fully realize this before I stand next to my bed out of habit. Sometimes I'm also dreaming so much that I think of French irregular verbs or a top quarrel. When this is over, I only notice that there has been shooting and I have remained silent in the room. But most of the time happens, as said above. Soon a pillow plus handkerchief is put in the hand, bathrobe on, slippers and then on a hollow to father, just as Margot wrote in a birthday poem:
At night at the first shooting,
There a door creaks and sees ...
A handkerchief, a pillow and a little girl ...'
Once at the big bed, the worst scare is already gone, unless the shooting was very hard.
Quarter to seven: Trrrr ... the alarm clock, which can raise its voice at any hour of the day (if one asks about it or sometimes without it). Knak ... Pang... Madam dropped it off. Crack ... sir has risen. Put on water and then uks to the bathroom.
Quarter past seven: The door creaks again. Dussel can go to the bathroom. Once alone is de-obscured ... and the new day in the Secret Annex has begun.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 5 August, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Today we take the schaftuurtje once.
It's half a: The whole rata plan breathes. Now the warehouse workers have gone home.
Upstairs one hears the stomping of the vacuum cleaner over mrs.'s beautiful and only dress. Margot takes a few books under her arm and goes to Dutch education 'for children who can't get any further', because dussel looks like that. Pim sits in a corner with his inseparable Dickens, just to find peace somewhere. Mother rushes one floor higher to help the nijv're housewife and I go to the bathroom to fix it up a bit, at the same time as myself.
Quarter to one: The bucket is dripping full. First Mr Van Santen, then Koophuis or Kraler, Elli and sometimes also Miep.
An hour: Tensely everything is listening to the B.B.C. They sit around the baby radio and these are the only minutes, where the members of the Secret Annex do not agree with each other, because here someone speaks that even Mr. Van Daan cannot contradict.
Quarter past one: The big distribution. Everyone from downstairs gets a cup of soup and if there is a dessert, also some of it. Satisfied, Mr Van Santen sits on the couch or leans against the writing desk. The newspaper, the cup and usually the cat next to her. If one of these three fails, he will not fail to protest. Koophuis tells the latest news from the city, he is indeed an excellent source for this. Kraler comes up the stairs, a short and firm tap on the door and he comes in hand-rubbing and, depending on the mood, in a good mood and busy or bad-tempered and quiet.
Quarter to two: The eaters rise up and everyone goes back to their own activities. Margot and mother the dishes, mr and mrs on their divan. Peter in the attic, father in the divan downstairs, Dussel on his and Anne at work. Now comes the quietest hour, when all are asleep no one is disturbed. Dussel dreams of good food, his face really looks forward to that and I don't look long, because time is rushing and at four o'clock the pedantic dr is already standing with the clock in hand, because A minute over time I clear the table for him.
Your Anne.
Monday, 9 August 1943
Dear Kitty,
This time continuation of the Achterhuis daily schedule. After the lunch hour, it's the turn of the afternoon table:
Mr. Van Daan opens the row. He is served first, takes quite a lot of everything, if it tastes good to him. Usually talk along, always express his opinion and once that is the case, there is no question about it. Because if someone dares to do that, then he is not wrong for a long time. Oh... he can blow against you like a cat ... I'd rather not have it, though... if you have experienced it once, not a second time.
He has the best opinion, he knows the most about everything. Well, he has a handsome head, but 'self-righteousness' has reached a high degree in that gentleman.
Madame: Actually, I'd better keep quiet. On some days, especially when a bad mood is coming, there is no looking into her face. On the face of it, she is the culprit of all the discussions. Not the subject! Oh no, everyone prefers to stay away from that, but one could perhaps call her the instigator. Firing, that's a fun job. Firing against Mrs. Frank and Anne. Against Margot and father, it's not so easy.
But now at the table. Madam is not short, although she sometimes thinks so. The smallest potatoes, the tastiest snack, the best of all; searching is madame's watchword. The others will get their turn, as long as I have the best first.
Then talk. Whether someone is listening, whether someone is interested or not, that does not seem to matter, she certainly thinks: 'what Mrs Van Daan says interests everyone ...'
Coquet smiling, pretending to know about everything, giving everyone a little advice and mothering, that must give a good impression. But if you look longer, the good is long gone.
Industrious one, cheerful two, coquet three and sometimes a nice snout. - This is Petronella van Daan.
The 3rd table companion: One doesn't hear much about it. The young gentleman Van Daan is most quiet and does not show much of himself. As for appetite: a Danaïden vessel, it never gets full and at the heaviest meal he claims with a deadly face that he could still eat double.
No 4 Margot: Eat like a mouse, don't talk at all. The only thing that goes into it is vegetables or fruit. 'Spoiled' is Van Daan's opinion, 'too little air and sport' is our opinion.
In addition, mom: Strong appetite, busy talker. No one has the idea, as with Mrs. Van Daan: that is the housewife. Where's the difference? Well, madam cooks and mother washes off and brushes.
No 6 and 7: I won't say much about father and me. The first is the most modest of the whole table. He first looks to see if the others also have. He doesn't need anything, the best things are for the children. There is the example of the good, next to the nerve pill of the Achter house.
Dr Dussel: Takes, doesn't look, eat, doesn't talk. And if one has to talk, then for heaven's sake about food; there will be no quarrel, only cutting. Huge portions go in and 'no' is never said, not with the good and not often with the bad. - The pants are on the chest, the red jacket, black slippers and horn glasses. So one can see him at the table, eternally working, only alternated by the afternoon nap, food and ... the sweetest spot ... the W.C. Three, four, five times a day someone stands impatiently in front of the W.C. door and squeezes, hips from one leg to the other and is almost unstoppable. Does it bother him? Nothing, from quarter past seven to half past eight, from half past one to one hour, from two hours to quarter past two, from four hours to quarter past four, from six hours to quarter past six and from half past twelve to twelve hours. One can write it down, these are the fixed 'session times'. It is not deviated from and he is not bothered by the pleading voice outside the door, which warns of a rapidly approaching disaster.
No 9: Is not a Secret Annex family member, but a housemate and table companion. Elli has a healthy appetite. Leave nothing, is not picky. With anything one can please her and that is precisely what pleases us. Cheerful and good-humoured, willing and good-natured, these are her characteristics.
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 10 August 1943
Dear Kitty,
New idea: I talk more with myself at the table than with the others, that's in two
aspects favorable. Firstly, they are all happy, if I do not babble in one piece and secondly, I do not have to be annoyed by someone else's judgment. I don't think my opinion is stupid and others do; so I better keep it to myself. Just like that, when I have to eat something, I do what I can't stand at all. I take the plate in front of me, imagine that it is something very tasty, look at it as little as possible and before I know it it is gone. In the morning when I get up, also something that is very unpleasant, I jump out of bed, think to myself 'you're going to get back in', walk to the window, de-obscure, sniff the crack for so long until I feel a little air and am awake.
The bed is explained as soon as possible, then there is no more temptation. Do you know what mom calls something like that? 'A life artist!' Don't you think that's a funny word? We have all been a bit confused with time since a week, since our dear and dear Westertoren clock has apparently been removed for war purposes, and we know exactly what time it is day or night. I still have some hope that they will invent something that reminds the neighborhood a bit of the clock, for example a pewter, copper or I know what kind of thing.
Whether I'm upstairs, downstairs or wherever, everyone looks at me admiringly on my feet, with a pair of rare beautiful shoes (for this time) on display. Miep bought them second-hand for ƒ 27.50: wine red peau de suede with leather and a rather high block heel. I walk like on stilts and look much bigger than I already am.
Dussel has indirectly put us in mortal danger. He had Miep bring a forbidden book, a scheldexemp copy on Mussolini and Hitler. On the way she happened to be hit by an S.S. engine. She lost her self-control, shouted 'miserable people' and drove on. Let me not think about what would have happened if she had to go to the desk with me.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
Above this piece the title: The task of the day in the community: potato peeling! One gets the newspapers, the second the blades (of course keeps the best for himself), the third the potatoes, the fourth the pan with water.
Mr Dussel starts, does not always scratch well, but scratches without ceasing, looks left and right: is everyone doing it the same way as he does? No: 'Anne, look, I'll take the knife in my hand, scratch from above below! Nein, if not ... but like that!'
'I find it so easier otherwise, Mr Dussel', I remark timidly.
'But this is the best way. Du kannst dies from me anyway. Of course I don't care, aber Du musst knows it yourself'.
We scratch again. I take a look at my neighbor. He shakes his head again in his mind (certainly about me), but remains silent.
I scratch again. Then look at the other side now, where father is sitting; for father, scratching potatoes is not a chore, but a precise job. When he reads, he has a deep wrinkle in the back of his head, but when he helps prepare potatoes, beans or other vegetables, it seems that nothing penetrates him. Then he has his potato face and he will never have a less well-scratched potato a everen; that simply does not exist when he pulls such a face.
I keep working again and then I look up again for a moment; now I already know enough. Madam tries if she can't get Dussel's attention. First she looks at him for a moment and Dussel pretends that he doesn't notice anything. Then she winks; Dussel continues to work. Then she laughs; Dussel doesn't look up. Then mother laughs too; Dussel doesn't care. She has achieved nothing, now she has to come up with something else. A moment of silence, then: 'Putti, put on an apron! Tomorrow I have to remove the stains from your suit again!'
"I don't get dirty!"
Silence again.
"Putti, why don't you sit down?"
'I'm fine like that, I'd rather stand!' Break.
'Putti, look Du spatst schon!'
'Yes, mammi, I'll be careful'. She is looking for another subject.
"Say, Putti, why don't the English bomb now?"
'Because the weather is too bad, Kerli'.
'But yesterday the weather was nice and they didn't fly either'.
"Let's not talk about that."
'Why, can't you talk about that or say your opinion about it?' 'No'.
"Why not now?"
"Be quiet now, mammi'chen."
'Mr. Frank always answers his wife, doesn't he?'
Sir struggles, this is his tender place, he can't stand it, and madam begins
always again:
'The invasion will never come!' Sir becomes white, if mrs. notices that
she red, but she continues anyway:
'The English don't perform anything!' The bomb bursts.
"And now you keep your mouth shut, donnerwetter-noch-einmal!"
Mother can hardly stop her laughter, I look straight in front of me.
Something like that repeats itself almost every day, if they haven't just had a bad fight.
because then both Mr. and Mrs. keep their mouths shut.
I have to get some potatoes to the attic. There Peter is busy defrosting the cat. He looks up, the cat notices, hup ... it's gone through the open window, into the gutter. Peter curses, I laugh and disappear.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
Exactly half past six the men from the warehouse go home and then we have the freedom.
Half 6: Elli comes to give us the evening freedom. The company is about to make a head start. I first go upstairs with Elli, where she usually gets our evening dessert ahead.
Elli is not sitting yet, or mrs. starts to list all her wishes, it soon sounds: 'Ah, Elli, I have a wish ...'
Elli winks at me, madam will not skip once to make her wishes known to whoever comes up. That's certainly one of the reasons why none of them like to go upstairs.
Quarter to 6: Elli leaves. I'm going to look two floors down. First to the kitchen, then to the private office, then to the coal shed to open the mouse door for Mouschi. After a long inspection trip, I end up in Kraler's apartment. Van Daan looks in all drawers and folders to find the mail of the day. Peter gets the warehouse key and Mof ; Pim drags typewriters upstairs; Margot is looking for a quiet place to do her office work; mrs puts a kettle of water on the gas stove; mother comes down the stairs with a pan of potatoes; everyone knows their own work.
Soon Peter comes out of the warehouse again. The first question applies to bread. This is always put in the kitchen cabinet by the ladies, but there it is not. So forgot? Peter wants to search in the front office. He makes himself as small as possible in front of the door of this office and crawls on all fours, so as not to be seen from the outside, to the steel cupboard, grabs the bread, which was stored there and disappears, at least, he wants to disappear, but before he realizes what has happened, Mouschi has jumped over him and sat all the way under the writing desk.
Peter searches for all sides, ha, there he sees the cat, again he crawls into the office and pulls the animal by the tail. Mouschi blows, Peter sighs. What has he achieved? Mouschi now sits all the way by the window and licks himself, very satisfied to have escaped Peter. Now Peter, as a last resort, holds up a piece of bread to the cat and yes, Mouschi is seduced and the door closes.
I watched it all, through the ass of the door. We continue to work. Tap, tap, tap. ... Beaten three times, dinner time!
Your Anne.
Monday, 23 August 1943
Dear Kitty,
Continuation of the Achterhuis daily schedule: when the clock strikes half past nine in the morning! Margot and mother are nervous: 'Sst ... father, silent Otto, sst ... Pim! It's half past nine; come here now, you can't let the water run anymore; walk gently!' These are the various exclamations for father in the bathroom. At the stroke of half past nine he must be in the room. Not a drop of water, not a W.C., not walking, everything quiet. If no one from the office staff is present yet, everything for the warehouse is even noisier.
Upstairs the door is opened at ten to half past nine and shortly thereafter three taps on the ground: the porridge for Anne. I climb up the stairs and the dog saucer is taken off.
Coming downstairs in my room, everything goes quickly, quickly: do her, tinker bus away, bed in place. Quiet, the clock strikes! Mrs upstairs changes shoes and swears around the room on bath slippers, sir also on slippers; everything at rest.
Now the ideal family scene is at its peak. I want to read or learn, Margot too, as well as father and mother. Father sits (of course with Dickens and the dictionary) on the edge of the sagging squeaky-bed, where there are not even decent mattresses: two pelts on top of each other also serve. 'I don't have to, I can do without it!'
Once reading, he doesn't look up or around, laughs occasionally, makes a terrible effort to force a story on mother. Answer: "I don't have time now." For a moment he looks disappointed, then he reads again; a little later, when something typically fun comes up again, he tries again: 'You have to read this, mother!'
Mother sits on the folding bed, reads, sews, knit or learns, just whatever is next. Suddenly something strikes her. Quickly say: 'Anne, you know ... Margot, write down ...!'
After a while, peace has returned. With a blow Margot closes her book, father squeezes his eyebrows in a funny arc, his reading wrinkle folds again and he is engrossed again; mother starts to chat with Margot, I get curious, listen too! Pim is involved in the case ... Nine o'clock! Breakfast!
Your Anne.
Friday, 10 September 1943
Dear Kitty,
Every time I write to you, something special has happened, but most of the time it's more unpleasant than pleasant things. Now, however, something is going on. Wednesday evening, September 8th, we were on the seven o'clock radio and the first thing we heard was: 'Here follows the best news of the whole war. Italy had capitulated!' Italy unconditionally capitulated! At a quarter past eight the Orange channel started: 'Listeners, an hour ago, when I had just finished the chronicle of the day, the delicious message of the capitulation of Italy came in. I can say that I have never been so happy to put my paper in the trash as I do today!" God save the King, the American national anthem and the Internationale were played. As always, the Orange Channel was heart-lifting and yet not too optimistic.
Yet we also have trouble, it concerns Mr Koophuis. You know, we all love him very much and although he is always sick, in a lot of pain and is not allowed to eat and walk much, he is always cheerful and admirably courageous. 'When Mr Koophuis comes in, the sun rises', mother said recently, and she is quite right.
Now he had to go to the hospital for a very unpleasant bowel operation and will have to stay there for at least four weeks. You should have seen how he said goodbye to us, as if he was going to do an errand, so ordinary.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 16 September 1943
Dear Kitty,
The mutual relationship here is getting worse and worse. At the table, no one dares to open their mouth (except to let a bite slide into it), because what you say is either resented or misconstrued. I take Valerians every day for anxiety and depression, but that does not prevent my mood from being even more miserable the next day. A good and hard laugh would help better than ten Valerians, but we have almost forgotten how to laugh. Sometimes I am afraid that the seriousness will give me a straightened face and drooping mouth. With the others it is no better, all look up with frightened premonitions against the large boulder, which is called winter.
Another fact, which does not give us a boost, is that the warehouse man v.M. becomes suspicious about the Secret Annex. We would not care what v.M. thinks of the situation, if the man did not possess a high degree of curiosity and does not allow himself to be steered with a lump in the reeds and, moreover, is not reliable.
One day Kraler wanted to be extra careful, put on his coat ten minutes before one and went to the drugstore around the corner. Less than five minutes later he was back, sneaked like a thief up the steep stairs, which lead directly up and came to us. At a quarter past one he wanted to leave again, but met Elli who warned him that v.M. was in the office. Kraler turned around and sat with us until half past two. Then he took his shoes in his hand and walked on stocking feet to the door of the attic, then went down the stairs foot by foot and after balancing on the stairs for a whole fifteen minutes to prevent the cracking, he ended up in the office from the street side.
Elli meanwhile, freed from v.M. for a moment, came to pick up Mr. Kraler from us, but he was long gone, he was still sitting on stocking feet on the stairs. What must the people on the street have thought when the director put his shoes back on outside? Ha, that director on socks!
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 29 September 1943
Dear Kitty,
It's Mrs. Van Daan's birthday. We have her, except for a cheese, meat and
bread voucher only a jar of jam as a gift. From her husband, Dussel and our protectors, she also received only flowers or food items. That's just the way the times are!
Elli had half a nerve eruption of the week, so often she was sent out, it was always insisted that she had to get something quickly, that she had to walk again or that she had done it wrong. If you then consider that she has to finish her work downstairs in the office, Koophuis is sick, Miep is at home with a cold, she herself sprains her ankle, has heartbreak and a grumbling father, then you can imagine that she is sitting with her hands in her hair. We comforted her and told her that if she energetically claimed a few times that she doesn't have time, those shopping lists would automatically get smaller.
With Van Daan it goes wrong again, I can already see it coming! Father is very furious for some reason. Oh, what eruption is hanging over our heads again? If only I wasn't so closely connected to all those skirmishes, if only I could leave. They still drive us crazy!
Your Anne.
Sunday, 17 October, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Owner-occupied house is back, fortunately! He still sees some bleach but goes out on the street to sell clothes for Van Daan. It is a fact that the money of the Van Daans is radically depleted. Mrs. does not want to miss anything of her pile of coats, dresses and shoes, Mr. His suit is difficult to get rid of, because he asks too high prices. The end of the song is not yet in sight. Madam will have to give up her fur coat. Upstairs they have had a big fight about this and now the reconciliation period of 'oh, dear Putti' and 'cute Kerli' has entered.
I am sick of the swear words that have flown through this honorable house in the last month. Father walks around with pressed lips; when someone calls him, he looks up so skittishly, as if he is afraid of having to fix up a precarious matter again. Mother has red spots of excitement on her cheeks. Margot complains of headaches, Dussel can't sleep, mrs complains all day and I myself have completely lost my mind. Honestly, I sometimes forget who we're arguing with and which person the reconciliation has already taken place with.
The only thing a eidt is learning and I do that a lot. Your Anne.
Friday, 29 October, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Here again there were resounding quarrels between Mr. and Mrs. It came like this: as I already wrote, the money of the Van Daans has run out. One day, some time ago, Koophuis talked about a furrier friend; that's why mr. came up with the idea to sell mrs.'s fur coat. It is a fur coat made of rabbit skins and worn for seventeen years. ƒ 325. - he got for it, this is a huge amount. However, mrs. wanted to keep the money to buy new clothes after the war and it had a lot of feet in the earth, before Mr. had made it clear to her, that the money in the household was urgently needed.
That screaming, screaming, stomping and name-calling is impossible to imagine. It was terrifying. My family stood at the bottom of the stairs with bated breath, to keep the fighters apart if necessary. All that screaming, crying and nervousness are so exciting and strenuous that I fall into my bed crying at night and thank heavens for having half an hour to myself.
Mr Koophuis is absent again; his stomach does not leave him alone. He himself does not even know yet whether the blood has already been stemmed. He was very down for the first time when he told us that he was not feeling well and went home.
I'm doing well in general, except that I have no appetite at all. Again and again I hear: 'You look so bad'. I have to say that they are very much trying to keep me on track. Grape sugar, cod liver oil, yeast tablets and lime must be used.
I am not always in control of my nerves, especially on Sundays I feel miserable. Then the mood in the house is oppressive, sleepy and heavy. Outside you don't hear a bird singing, a dead and oppressive silence hangs over everything and this heavy one clings to me, as if I had to go with him to a deep underworld.
Father, mother and Margot leave me indifferent at times, I wander from one room to another, down the stairs and up again and have a feeling like a songbird, whose wings have been violently torn out and which flies in complete darkness against the bars of his narrow cage. "Out, air and laugh," it screams into me. I don't even answer anymore, lie down on a couch and sleep to shorten the time, the silence, the terrible fear too, because they are not to kill.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 3 November 1943
Dear Kitty,
In order to provide us with some guidance and development, father has requested a prospectus from the Leiden Educational Institution. Margot nosed through the thick book three times, without finding anything to her liking and her purse. Father was quicker to find something, he wanted to have the institution write and ask for a proe es 'Elementary Latin'. So said, so done, the lesson came, Margot enthusiastically went to work and the course was taken. For me, he is far too difficult, although I would love to learn Latin.
To let me also start something new, father asked Koophuis for a children's Bible, to finally find out something about the New Testament. "Do you want to give Anne a Bible for Chanukah?" asked Margot, somewhat upset. "Yes ... er, I think Saint Nicholas is a better opportunity," father replied. 'Jesus simply does not fit on Chanukah'.
Your Anne.
Monday evening, 8 November 1943
Dear Kitty,
If you were to read through my pile of letters one after the other, you would certainly notice in what different moods my letters were written. I myself find it annoying that I am so dependent on votes here in the Secret Annex, I am not alone, that is all of us. When I read a book that impresses me, I have to thoroughly create order in myself before I go among people, otherwise people would think of me as having a somewhat strange mind. At the moment, as you will notice, I have a period in which I am depressed. I really couldn't tell you how I came to be, but I believe it's my cowardice that I keep bumping into.
Tonight, when Elli was still there, there was a long, loud and penetrating call. At that moment I turned white, got abdominal pain and palpitations and all from the fear.
In the evening in bed I see myself in a dungeon alone, without father and mother. Sometimes I wander by the road, or our Secret Annex is on fire, or they come to take us away at night. I see everything, as if I experience it on my own body and have the feeling that all this will happen to me immediately!
Miep often says that she envies us, because we have peace here. That may well be true, but she certainly does not think of our fear. I can't imagine the world ever becoming normal for us again. I do talk about 'after the war', but then that is, as if I am talking about a pipe dream, something that can never become reality. I think of our former home, the girlfriends, school jokes, of all that as something that someone other than myself has experienced.
I see us eight together with the Secret Annex, as if we were a piece of blue sky, surrounded by heavy, black rain clouds. The round, demarcated spot on which we stand is still safe, but the clouds are moving closer and closer to us and the ring, which separates us from the approaching danger, is tightened ever closer. Now we are already so surrounded by danger and darkness that we collide with each other in despair, where to find rescue. We all look down where the people are fighting each other, we all look up, where it is quiet and beautiful and meanwhile we are cut off by that dark mass, which does not let us go up, but which stands before us like an impenetrable wall, which wants to crush us, but cannot yet. I can do nothing but shout and beg, "O ring, ring widen and open to us!"
Your Anne.
Thursday, 11 November, 1943
Dear Kitty,
I just got a good title for this chapter:
Ode to my Fountain Pen. In Memoriam.
My fountain pen was always a precious possession for me; I appreciated her highly, especially because of the thick tip she had, because I can only write really neatly with thick fountain pen tips. My fountain pen has had a very long and interesting fountain pen life, which I want to share briefly.
When I was 9 years old, my fountain pen came in a package (wrapped in cotton wool) as a 'monster without value' all the way from Aachen, the hometown of my grandmother, the good giver. I was lying in bed with the flu, while the February wind howled around the house. The glorious fountain pen had a red leather spout around it and was immediately shown to all my friends. I, Anne Frank, the proud owner of a fountain pen.
When I was 10 years old, I was allowed to take the pen to school and the teacher actually allowed me to write with it.
At 11, however, my treasure had to be put away again, as the sixth-grade teacher only allowed school pens and ink pots as writing utensils.
When I turned 12 and went to the Jewish Lyceum, my fountain pen was given a new pencil case in several honors, which could be accompanied by a pencil and which was also much more real, since it closed with a zipper.
With 13 the fountain pen went to the Secret Annex, where she ran with me through countless diaries and writings.
When I was 14 years old, that was the last year my fountain pen had completed with me, and now...
It was on Friday afternoon after five o'clock that I wanted to sit down at the table from my room to write, when I was violently pushed aside and had to make way for Margot and father who practiced their 'Latin'. The fountain pen remained unused on the table, and her owner sighingly settled for a very small corner of the table and started rubbing beans. 'Rubbing beans' here is bringing moldy kidney beans back into their decency.
At a quarter to six I went to sweep the ground and threw the dirt along with the bad beans on a newspaper and in the stove. A great flame came out and I thought it was wonderful that in this way the stove, which had been on apegapen, recovered. Peace had returned, the Latins coughed up and I sat down at the table to record my intended writing, but, wherever I looked, my fountain pen was nowhere to be seen. I searched again, Margot searched, mother searched, father searched, Dussel searched, but the thing had disappeared without a trace.
"Maybe she fell into the stove at the same time as the beans," Margot suggested. "Ah, no, child!" I replied.
However, when my fountain pen did not want to appear in the evening, we all assumed that it had been burned, especially since celluloid burns huge.
And really, the sad expectation was confirmed, when father found the clip, with which you stick a fountain pen, in the middle of a load of ash the other morning when taking out the stove. There was nothing left of the golden pen. 'Definitely baked in some stone', father thought.
One consolation has remained with me, even if it is only meager: my fountain pen has been cremated, just what I want so badly later!
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 17 November, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Home-shattering events underway.
At Elli's home there is diphtery, which is why she is not allowed to come into contact with us for six weeks. Both with food and with shopping it is very difficult, not to mention the unpleasantness. Koophuis is still lying and has had nothing but milk and porridge for three weeks. Kraler is extremely busy.
Margot's submitted Latin lessons are returned corrected by a teacher. Margot writes under Elli's name, the teacher is very nice and witty. He is certainly happy that he got such a handsome student.
Dussel is completely confused, none of us know why. It started with him squeezing his mouth and not speaking a word to either Mr. or Mrs. Everyone noticed this and when it lasted a few days, mother took the opportunity to warn him about madam, who could indeed cause him many unpleasant things if he continued like this.
Dussel said that Mr. Van Daan had started to remain silent and he had no intention of breaking his silence.
Now you should know that yesterday was November 16, the day on which he spent a year in the Secret Annex. Mother was honoured with a jar of flowers on the occasion of this, but Mrs. Van Daan, who had already made an allusion to this date several times in advance weeks in advance and did not hide her opinion that Dussel should treat, got nothing. Instead of expressing his gratitude for the selfless recording for the first time, he didn't speak at all. And when I asked him on the morning of the 16th whether I should congratulate him or offer condolences, he replied that he received everything. Mother, who wanted to act for the beautiful role of peacemaker, did not make any progress with him and in the end the situation remained the same.
'Der Mann hat einen grossen Geist Und ist so klein von Taten!'
Your Anne.
Saturday, 27 November, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Last night before the ins'apen suddenly came before my eyes: Lies.
I saw her in front of me, dressed in rags with a dilapidated and emaciated face.
Her eyes were very big, and she looked at me so sadly and reproachfully that I could read in her eyes, "Oh Anne, why did you leave me? Help, O help me, save me from this hell!"
And I can't help her, I can only watch other people suffer and die, and I can only pray to God to bring her back to us.
I saw Lies, no one else and I understood. I misjudged her, was too much of a child to understand her difficulties. She was attached to her new friend and it seemed as if I wanted to take it away from her. How must the poor person have felt, I know, I know that feeling so well myself!
Sometimes, in an its, I saw something of her life, to selfishly immediately go back into her own pleasures and difficulties. It was ugly of me as I acted with her and now she looked at me with her pale face and pleading eyes oh so helpless. If only I could help her!
O God, that I have everything I could wish for here and that she has been dealt with in this way by the hard fate. She was at least as pious as I was, she also wanted the good, so why was I chosen to live and perhaps she should die? What was the difference between us? Why are we so far apart now?
Honestly, I almost forgot about her for months, yes a year. Not quite, but I never thought of her in such a way that I saw her in all her misery in front of me.
Ah Lies, I hope that if you would still experience the end of the war and come back to us, I can take you in, to compensate you for something of what has been done wrong against you.
But if I'm able to help her again, she won't need my help as much as she does now. Would she think of me again and what will she feel?
Good God, give her support, so that she is not alone. Oh, if only you could tell her that I think of her with love and pity; it might strengthen her in her endurance.
I can't think any further, because I can't figure it out. I see her big eyes over and over again, which don't let go of me. Would Lies really have faith in herself, wouldn't she have had the faith forced on her from the outside alone?
I don't even know that, I never bothered to ask her.
Lies, Lies, if only I could take you away from where you are now, I could only let you share in everything I enjoy. It's too late, I can't help anymore and I can't recover, which I did wrong. But I will never forget her and always pray for her.
Your Anne.
Monday, 6 December 1943
Dear Kitty,
When Sinterklaas approached, we all thought involuntarily-neatly of the nicely made basket of last year and especially to me it seemed annoying to skip everything this year. I thought for a long time, until I found something, something funny.
Pim was consulted and a week ago we went to work to make a verse for all eight.
Sunday evening at a quarter past eight we appeared upstairs with the large laundry basket between us, which was decorated with guurtjes and bows of pink and blue wrapping paper. Over the basket was a large piece of wrapping paper, on which a note was attached. All were somewhat surprised at the extent of the surprise.
I took the note off the paper and read:
Prologue
Sinterklaas has also come again this year, Even the Secret Annex has heard it Unfortunately, we can not do it as nicely as it was done last year.
Then we were hopeful and thought decidedly That victorious would be the optimist
And thought that this year was free
Saint Nicholas to celebrate they.
Yet we want to remember the day, But since now there is nothing left to give, So we must do something else:
Everyone looks in their shoe!
(while dad and I lit up the wrapping paper).
A thunderous laughter followed, when each owner took his shoe out of the basket.
In each shoe was a small package wrapped in paper with the address of the shoe owner.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 22 December, 1943
Dear Kitty,
A severe flu prevented me from writing to you earlier than today. It's miserable to be sick here. When I had to cough I crawled one, two, three under the covers and tried to silence my throat as gently as possible, which usually resulted in the itch not going away at all and milk with honey, sugar or pastilles had to be used. When I think of the cures they let me go through, it swirls. Sweating, covers, wet breast flaps, dry breast flaps, hot drinking, gargling, brushing, lying still, heat kissing, jugs, lemon brush and the thermometer every two hours.
Can one actually get better in such a way? The worst thing I found, when Mr. Dussel went to play doctor and lay down with his pomade head on my bare chest, to listen to the sounds inside. Not only that his hair tickled me terribly, I was embarrassed despite the fact that he once studied thirty years ago and has the doctor's title. What does that guy have to do with my heart? He is not my beloved! By the way, what is healthy or not healthy in there, he does not hear anyway, his ears must first be sprayed out, because he fearfully starts to look a lot like a hard of hearing person.
But now enough about the disease. I'm chicken-loving again, grown an inch, gained two pounds, pale and eager to learn.
There is not much news to report. Exceptionally, the relationship here is good, no one has a quarrel, we have not had such a house peace for at least six months. Elli is still separated from us.
We get extra oil, candy and syrup for Christmas; the 'gift' is a brooch, manufactured from a slice of two and a half cents and this neatly shiny. And n, inexplicable beautiful. Mr Dussel has given mother and Mrs Van Daan a beautiful cake as a gift, which Miep baked at his request. With all the work, Miep still has to do that! I also have something for Miep and Elli. For two months I have saved the sugar of my porridge and will, through the mediation of Mr Koophuis, have breastplates made.
The weather is drizzly, the stove stinks, the food presses heavily on all stomachs which causes thunderous noises on all sides; war standstill, rotten mood.
Your Anne.
Friday, 24 December, 1943
Dear Kitty,
I have written before, that we are all dealing with votes here, and I believe that this ailment has been on the rise for me, especially recently. 'Himmelhoch jauchzend und zum Tode betrübt' certainly applies here. 'Himmelhoch jauchzend' I am, when I think about how well we have it here and compare myself with other Jewish children and 'zum Tode betrübt' strikes me, when for example, as today, Mrs Koophuis has been here and tells of her daughter Corry's hockey club, canoe trips, stage performances and friends. I don't think I'm jealous of Corry, but I do get such a strong desire to have fun and laugh until I get a stomachache. Especially now in the winter with all those free Christmas and New Year's days, then we sit here as outcasts and yet I am not actually allowed to write these words down, because then I seem ungrateful and it is also exaggerated. But whatever you may think of me, I can't keep everything to myself and then just quote my opening words: 'Paper is patient'.
If someone is just coming from outside, with the wind in their clothes and the cold on their face, I would like to put my head under the covers so as not to think: 'When will we be allowed to smell air again?' And because I am not allowed to hide my head in blankets, on the contrary to keep it upright and ink, the thoughts come, not once but oh well, countless times. Believe me, if you're locked up for a year and a half, it can become too much for you on some days. Despite all righteousness or gratitude; feelings cannot be suppressed. Cycling, dancing, expressing, looking out into the world, feeling young, knowing that I am free, I crave that and yet I am not allowed to show it, because think about it, if all eight of us were going to complain or put on dissatisfied faces, where is that going to go? I sometimes ask myself: 'Would anyone understand me in this, look over Jew or non-Jew, only see in me the fry fish, which has such a need for exuberant fun?' I don't know, and I wouldn't be able to talk to anyone about it, because I know I'm going to cry. Crying can bring such relief.
Despite theories and difficulties, every day I miss the real mother who understands me. That's why I think in everything I do and what I write, that I want to be the 'mom' I imagine for my children. The mom who doesn't take everything so seriously, what is said like that and serious, what comes from me. I notice, I can't describe it, but the word mom says it all. You know what I thought about saying something like mom to my mom? I often call her 'mansa' and from that comes 'mans'. It is, as it were, the imperfect mams, whom I would love to worship with another paw on the 'n', but who does not realize this. Fortunately, it is, because she would be unhappy about it.
Enough about that, my 'zum Tode betrübt' has passed a bit when writing.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
In these days, now that Christmas is only one day away, I have to think about Pim all the time and what he told me about his childhood sweetheart last year. Last year I didn't understand the meaning of his words as well as I understand them now. If he only spoke again, maybe I would be able to show him that I understood him.
I believe Pim talked about this, because he who 'knows so many secrets of others', also had to express himself once; because Pim never says anything about himself otherwise and I do not believe that Margot suspects what Pim has had to go through. Poor Pim, he can't tell me that he has forgotten everything. He will never forget this. He has become yielding. I hope that I will look a bit like him, without having to go through all that.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
Friday night, for the first time in my life, I got something for Christmas.
The girls, Koophuis and Kraler had prepared another wonderful surprise. Miep baked a Christmas cake, which said 'Peace 1944'. A pound of butter cookies of pre-war quality was provided by Elli. For Peter, Margot and me there was a esje yoghurt and for the adults each a esje beer. Everything was packed so nicely and pictures were stuck on the different packages. Christmas has passed for us.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 29 December, 1943
Dear Kitty,
Last night I was very sad again. Grandma and Lies came to my mind.
Grandma, oh that dear Grandma, how little we understood what she suffered, how sweet she was. And in doing so, she always carefully kept the terrible secret that she carried with her.
How faithful and good Grandma always was, none of us would ever have abandoned her. Whatever it was, no matter how naughty I had been, Grandma always apologized to me.
Grandma - did you love me or did you not understand me? I don't know. No one ever said anything about Grandma. How lonely Grandma must have been, how lonely in spite of us. A person can be lonely despite the love of many, because for no one is he 'the sweetest'. And Lies, is she still alive? What does it do? O God, protect her and bring her back to us. Lies, to you I always see how my fate could have been, I always see myself in your place. So why am I often still sad about what is happening here? Shouldn't I always be happy, content and happy, unless I think of her and her fellow sufferers?
I am selfish and cowardly. Why do I always dream and think the worst things and would I want to cry out in fear? Because I still, despite everything. God not trust enough. He has given me so much, which I certainly did not deserve and yet I still do so much wrong every day.
When one thinks of one's loved ones one has to cry, one can actually cry all day. There is nothing left but to pray that God will make a miracle happen and spare some of them. And I hope I do that enough!
Your Anne.
Sunday, 2 January, 1944
Dear Kitty,
When I had nothing to do this morning, I flipped through my diary and came several times to letters, which dealt with the subject of 'mother' in such rageous words that, shocked, I wondered: 'Anne, is it you who spoke about hate? Oh Anne, how could you do that!'
I sat with the open page in hand and thought about why I was so full of anger and really filled with something like hate, that I had to entrust everything to you. I have tried to understand and apologize to the Anne of a year ago, because my conscience is not clear, as long as I leave you with these accusations, without now explaining to you afterwards how I came to be.
I suffer and suffered from moods that kept me (possibly) with my head under water and showed things, as they were, only subjectively, without trying to think quietly about the words of the other party and then act in the mind of the one whom I have offended or saddened in my bubbling temperament.
I hid in myself, only looked at myself and wrote all my joys, ridicule and sadness undisturbed in my diary. This diary has a lot of value for me, because it has often become a memoir book, but on many pages I could put 'past'.
I was furious with mother, sometimes I still am. She didn't understand me, that's true, but I didn't understand her either. Since she did love me, she was tender, but since she also came through me in many unpleasant situations, and then because of this and by many other sad circumstances was nervous and stimulated, it is understandable that she cut me off.
I took this far too seriously, was offended, brutal and annoying to her, which in turn made her sad. So it was actually a back and forth of unpleasantness and sadness. It was certainly not pleasant for both of us, but it passes.
That I did not want to see this and felt a lot sorry for myself is also understandable. The sentences that are so intense are just expressions of anger, which in ordinary life I would have locked in a room with a few stamping feet, or name-calling behind mother's back.
The period when I condemn mother in tears is over.
I have become wiser and mother's nerves have calmed down a bit. I usually keep my mouth shut when I'm annoyed and she does too and that's why it seems to be much better. Because loving mother so real with the affectionate love of a child, I can't do that, I miss the feeling for that.
I now soothe my conscience with the thought that swear words are better on paper than that mother has to carry them in her heart.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 5 January, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Today I have to confess to you two things, which will take a lot of time, but which I have to tell someone and I can best do that to you, because I know for sure that you will always and under all circumstances remain silent.
The first is about mother. You know I complained a lot about mom and then made an effort to be nice to her. Suddenly it has become clear to me what is wrong with her. Mother herself has told us that she sees us more as her friends than as her daughters. That is very nice now, but still a friend cannot replace the place of a mother. I need to take my mother as an example and have respect for her. I have the feeling that Margot thinks so differently in all these things and would never understand what I have told you now. And father avoids all conversations, which will deal with mother.
I imagine a mother as a woman, who first of all shows a lot of tact, especially for her children who are in our age and who does not act like mansa, who, when I cry for something, not for pain but for other things, laughs at me.
One thing, it may seem trivial, I have never forgiven her. It was one day that I had to go to the dentist. Mother and Margot would go along and thought it was good that I took my etching with me. When we were finished at the dentist and were back at the door, Margot and mother told us that they were going to the city to see or buy something, I don't remember very precisely. I wanted to go along, but I wasn't allowed to, because I had my etching with me. Tears welled up in my eyes and Margot and mother started laughing at me. Then I became so furious that I stuck out my tongue against them on the street, while a small woman happened to pass by, who looked very frightened. I rode home on the etching and certainly cried for a long time.
It is strange that the wound that mother inflicted on me then still burns when I think about how angry I was then.
The second thing is something that takes a lot of effort for me to tell you, because it's about myself.
Yesterday I read an article by dra Sis Heyster, who wrote about blushing. She speaks in this article as if it were to me alone. Although I don't blush so easily, the other things that are in it still apply to me. She writes that a girl in the puberty years becomes silent in herself and starts to think about the miracles that are performed with her body.
I also have that and that is why lately I get the feeling that I am going to be embarrassed for Margot, mother and father. Margot, on the other hand, is much more shy than I am and is not embarrassed at all.
I find it so wonderful, that what happens to me and not only that which can be seen on the outer side of my body, but that which takes place within it. Precisely because I never talk to anyone about myself and all these things, I talk to myself about it.
Every time I have my period, and that has only happened three times, I have the feeling that, despite all the pain, misery and filth, I carry a sweet secret with me and therefore, even though it only bothers me, I always look forward in a way to the time when I will feel that secret in me again.
Sis Heyster also writes that young girls in those years are not entirely sure of themselves and will discover that they themselves are a human being with ideas, thoughts and habits. Since I came here shortly after my 13th year, I started thinking about myself earlier than other girls and knowing that I am a 'person in itself'. Sometimes in bed at night I get a terrible need to feel and hear my breasts, how calmly and surely my heart beats.
Subconsciously, I have had such feelings before I came here, because I know that when I once slept with a friend, I had a strong need to kiss her and that I did. I get ecstatic every time I see a bleak, like a Venus. I sometimes find it so wonderful and beautiful that I have to hold back so as not to let my tears roll.
If only I had a girlfriend! Your Anne.
Thursday, 6 January, 1944
Dear Kitty,
My desire to talk to someone became so great that I found it on the one
somehow in my head Peter got to choose from that.
Whenever I came upstairs in Peter's room, by light, I always found it there
very cozy, but because Peter is so modest and never puts someone who gets too difficult out the door, I never dared to stay any longer, because I was afraid that he would find me very annoying. I was looking for an opportunity to stay inconspicuously in the room and keep him talking and that opportunity arose yesterday. Peter has suddenly developed a mania for crossword puzzles and does nothing more than puzzle. I helped him with that and soon we were sitting opposite each other at his table, him on the chair, me on the divan.
I was wonderfully discouraged every time I looked into his dark blue eyes and he sat there with that mysterious smile around his mouth. I could read his inner self from everything, I could still see on his face that helplessness and that uncertainty how to keep himself and at the same time a hint of the awareness of his masculinity. I saw that shy attitude and became so soft inside, I couldn't resist meeting those dark eyes again and again and almost with all my heart: oh tell me what is going on inside you, oh look over that fateful chatter.
But the evening went by and nothing happened, except that I told him that about that blushing, of course not what I wrote down, but only that he would become more certain with the years.
In bed at night, I didn't find the whole situation exciting for a long time and the idea that I have to beg for Peter's favors was just repulsive. People do a lot to satisfy their desires, you can see that in me, because I decided to sit down with Peter more often and get him to talk in some way.
Under no circumstances should you think that I am in love with Peter, no way. If the Van Daans had had a daughter here instead of a son, I would have tried to make friends with her.
This morning I woke up at about five minutes before seven and immediately knew very well what I had dreamed. I was sitting on a chair and across from me was Peter... Wessel, we flipped through a book with drawings by Mary Bos. So clear was my dream that I still partially remember the drawings. But that wasn't all, the dream continued. Suddenly Peter's eyes met mine and for a long time I looked into those beautiful unemonic eyes. Then Peter said very softly, "If I had known that, I would have come to you a long time ago!" Brusk I turned around, because the emotion became too powerful for me. And then I felt a soft, oh so cool and soothing cheek against mine and everything was so good, so good...
At this point I woke up, still feeling his cheek against mine and feeling his brown eyes looking deep into my heart, so deep that he had read in it how much I had loved him and how much I still loved him. The tears jumped in my eyes again and I was very sad, because I had lost him again, but at the same time happy, because I knew with certainty that Peter is still my chosen one.
It is strange that I often get such clear dream images here. First I saw Omi1. one night so clearly, that I could distinguish her skin from thick, soft wrinkles. Then Grandma appeared as a guardian angel, then Lies, who still shows me the symbol of the misery of all my friends and all the Jews. When I pray for her, I pray for all Jews and poor people together. And now Peter, my dear Peter, never before has he come to my mind so clearly in my mind, I do not need to have a picture of him, I see him before my eyes oh so well!
Your Anne.
Friday, 7 January 1944
Dear Kitty,
Stupid that I am! I have not thought at all that I have never told you the history of me and all my admirers.
When I was very small, even in kindergarten, my sympathy had fallen on Karel Samson. He no longer had a father and lived with his mother with an aunt. A nephew of Karel, Robby, was a handsome, slender, dark boy, who aroused more and more admiration than the small, humorous fat bag, which was Karel. I didn't look at handsomeness, but I loved Karel very much for years.
For a while we were together a lot, but otherwise my love remained unrequited. Then Peter came my way and I got a real childhood love. He also liked me and one summer through we were inseparable. In my mind's eye I can still see us walking through the streets hand in hand, he in a white cotton suit, me in a short summer dress. At the end of the big holiday he came in the first grade of high school and I in the sixth grade of elementary school. He took me out of school and vice versa I picked me up. Peter was an image of a boy, tall, handsome, slender with a serious, calm and intelligent face. He had dark hair and beautiful brown eyes, reddish-brown cheeks and a pointed nose. I especially loved his smile, then he looked so bad boyish and mischievous. I went out on holiday; when I came back Peter had moved and lived with a much older boy. This apparently made him notice that I was a childish puk and Peter let me go. I loved him so much that I didn't want to see the truth and held him until the day came when it dawned on me that if I followed him any longer, I would be called a boy crazy. The years went by. Peter hung out with girls his own age and didn't think about greeting me anymore, but I couldn't forget him. I went to the Jewish Lyceum, many boys of our class fell in love with me, I liked it, was honored, but otherwise it did not affect me. Even later, Harry was very fond of me, but as I said, I never fell in love again.
There is a saying: 'Time heals all wounds'; that's how it was with me. I imagined that I had forgotten Peter and didn't like him at all. However, the memory of him lived on so strongly in my subconsciousness that I sometimes confessed to myself that I was jealous of those other girls and therefore did not like him anymore. This morning I understood that nothing has changed, on the contrary, as I grew older and more mature, my love grew in me. I can now understand that Peter thought I was childish then and yet it struck me again and again, that he had forgotten me so much. His face was so obvious to me and I now know that no one else could stay so trapped in me.
After the dream I am completely confused. When dad gave me a kiss this morning, I wanted to scream, "Oh, if only you were Peter!" I think of him in everything and all day I repeat nothing to myself but: 'O Petel, dear, sweet Petel ...!'
Who can help me now? I just have to live on and pray to God that when I get out of here, he will take Peter on my way and that, as he reads my feelings in my eyes, he will say, "O Anne, if I had known that, I would have come to you a long time ago!"
I've seen my face in the mirror and it looks so different. My eyes look so bright and so deep, my cheeks are, which hasn't happened in weeks, pink colored, my mouth is much softer, I look like I'm happy and yet there is something so sad in my expression, my smile immediately slips off my lips. I am not happy, because I could know that Peter's thoughts are not with me and yet, yet I feel his beautiful eyes fixed on me again and again, and his cool soft cheek against mine ...
O Petel, Petel, how do I ever get rid of your image again? Isn't everyone else in your place a pitiful surrogate? I love you, oh with so much love that it could no longer grow in my heart, but had to jump out and suddenly, in such a tremendous magnitude, revealed itself to me.
A week ago, a day ago, if I had been asked, "Which of your acquaintances would you find most suitable to marry?" I would have replied, "I don't know," and now I would shout, "Petel, for I love him with all my heart, with all my soul, in complete surrender!" Except for that one, he's not allowed to touch me any further than in my face.
Father once said to me, when we were talking about sexuality, that I still could not understand the desire; I always knew I understood and now I totally understand. Nothing is as dear to me now as he is, my Petel!
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 12 January, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Elli has been with us again for 14 days. Miep and Henk couldn't go on their
place, they had both spoiled their stomachs. I currently have dance and ballet whims and diligently practice dance steps every night. From a light blue underdress with lace by Mansa I made a hypermodern dance dress. From above there is a band extended, which closes above the chest; a pink ribbed ribbon completes the whole. In vain I tried to turn my gym shoes into real ballet adden. My stiff limbs are fast becoming supple, as they used to be. A banging exercise I find sitting on the floor, holding a heel with each hand and then lifting both legs in the height. I have to use a pillow as a pad, otherwise my poor tailbone will be abused too much.
Here they read a book Morning without Clouds titled. Mother thought it was extremely good; many childhood problems have been described in it. A bit ironically, I thought to myself: 'First, get more involved with your own childhood'.
I believe that mother thinks that Margot and I have the best relationship with our parents that exists, and that no one interferes in his children's lives more than she does. She certainly only looks at Margot, because I believe she never has such problems and thoughts as I have. I do not want to bring mother to mind at all that one of her sprouts looks very different from what she imagines, for she would be completely stunned and yet do not know how to handle the matter differently; I want to spare her the sadness that would follow for her, especially because I know that everything would remain the same for me.
Mother feels that Margot loves her much more than I do, but she thinks this is the case with periods! Margot has become so sweet, she seems very different to me than before, she is not so catty anymore and becomes a real friend. She no longer considers me at all to be the little uk that you don't have to take into account.
It is a strange phenomenon that I sometimes see myself as through the eyes of someone else. I look at the affairs of a certain 'Anne' at my leisure and sit in my own life book, as if it were from a stranger. In the past, at home, when I didn't think much, I sometimes had the feeling that I did not belong to Mansa, Pim and Margot and would always remain an outsider. Sometimes I played the role of an orphan for a while, until I punished myself and blamed myself for being nothing but my own fault, that I played the sufferer, while I always had it so good. Then followed a period in which I forced myself to be friendly. Every morning when someone came down the stairs I hoped that it would be mother who would say good morning to me, and I greeted her sweetly, because I really rejoiced that she looked at me so sweetly. Then, by some comment, she was unfriendly to me and then I went to school completely discouraged. On the way home I apologized to her, thought to myself that she had worries, came home cheerful, talked a hundred, until the same thing repeated itself and I went out with a pensive face with my school bag. Sometimes I decided to stay angry, but coming home from school I had so much news that I had long forgotten my intention and mother had to have an open ear for all my experiences under all circumstances. Then I got the time again, in which I no longer listened to steps on the stairs in the morning, felt lonely and in the evening my pillow was showered with tears.
Here everything has gotten much worse, and n, you know it.
One help in these things God has now sent me. 'Peter'...
I feel my pendant for a moment, press a kiss on it, and think: 'What can I do the
make a big mess too! Peter belongs to me and nobody knows about it'. That way I can overcome any snuggling.
Who would know how much goes on in a fryfish soul? Your Anne.
Saturday, 15 January, 1944
Dear Kitty,
It has no purpose that I describe quarrels and disputes to you again and again in detail. I think it is enough if I tell you that we have shared a lot of things, such as fat, butter and meat and bake our own potatoes. For some time now we have been eating some extra rye bread, because at four o'clock we were already eagerly looking forward to lunch and our rattling stomachs could hardly contain.
Mother's birthday is fast approaching. Kraler gave her extra sugar, a reason for jealousy on the part of the Van Daans, because on mrs's birthday the traction was skipped. But where else is it for each other with harsh words, crying fits and envious conversations to bore! Be assured, Kitty, that they are bored of us even more. Mother has expressed the for the time being unfeasible wish that she does not have to see the Van Daans for 14 days.
I repeatedly wonder whether all the people with whom one has lived for so long would eventually get into a quarrel. Or maybe we have been very shaky? Is the majority of humanity so selfish and scrappy? I think it's best that I've gotten a bit of people knowledge here, but it seems to me to be sufficient now. The war does not bother our quarrels, freedom and air tendencies and therefore we must try to make the best of our stay. I'm preaching, but I also believe that if I stay here for a long time, I'll become a dehydrated beanstalk. And I would love to be a real fry fish!
Your Anne.
Saturday, 22 January, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Can you tell me why it is that all people hide their inner selves so jealously? Why is it that I always do very differently in company than I had to do?
Why does one trust the other so little? I know, there will certainly be a reason, but sometimes I hate that you don't find confidentiality anywhere, even among the people who are next to you.
It seems to me, as if I have aged since the night of my dream, much more 'a person in itself'. You will be very surprised when I tell you that even the Van Daans have taken a different place with me. I suddenly no longer look at all these discussions and so on and so forth from our preconceived point of view.
How did I get so changed? Yes, you see, I suddenly thought that if mother was different, a real mom, our relationship would have been very, very different. It is of course true that Mrs. Van Daan is anything but a human being, but I still think that if mother was not also difficult to handle in every pointed conversation, half of all quarrels could have been avoided.
Mrs. Van Daan has one side of the sun and that is that you can talk to her. Despite all the selfishness, scrappyness and underhandedness, you can easily get her to give in, as long as you don't excite her and make her unruly. Until the next reason, this remedy does not work, but if you are a patient person, you can try again how far you get.
All our parenting issues, the pampering, the food, everything and everything would have taken a completely different course, if one had remained open and friendly and not always had only the bad sides in mind.
I know exactly what you'll say, Kitty. "But Anne, do these words really come from you? From you, who have had to hear so many harsh words from above, from you, who knows all the injustice that has happened?" And yet, it comes from me.
I want to understand everything again and not work according to the proverb: 'As the old sang, the boy squeaks'. I want to investigate the Van Daans myself and see what is true and what is exaggerated. If I have experienced the disappointment myself, I can draw the same line with father and mother again, if not, I will first try to dissuade them from their misrepresentation and if that does not work, then I will still uphold my own opinion and judgment. I will take every opportunity to talk openly with mrs. about many points of contention and not be afraid to say my neutral opinion, despite the name of wise nose.
I should not go against my own family now, but gossip on my part is, from today, a thing of the past.
Until now I thought that all the blame for the quarrels lies with the Van Daans, but part of it was certainly also with us. We were right about the subjects, but from sensible people (to which we count ourselves!) one expects a little more insight into how to treat other people. I hope that I have a little bit of that insight and will find the opportunity to use it well.
Your Anne.
Monday, 24 January, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Something has happened to me, or actually I cannot speak of happening, that I think is crazy.
In the past, at home and at school, gender issues were either secretively or disgustingly talked about. Words relating to it were inundated and often, when a person knew nothing, was laughed at. I thought that was strange and thought, 'Why do people talk about these things so secretively and annoyingly?' But because nothing seemed to change, I kept my mouth shut as much as possible or sometimes also asked friends for information.
When I was aware of a lot and had also spoken to my parents, mother said one day: 'Anne, I give you good advice, never talk to boys about this subject and do not give an answer when they start talking about it'. I know my answer very precisely, I said: 'No, of course not, imagine!'
And that's all.
In the beginning of the hiding period, father often told me some things that I would have preferred to hear from mother and the rest I learned from books or conversations. Peter van Daan was never as annoying in this area as the boys at school, in the beginning maybe a few times, but never to get me talking.
Madam had once told us that she had never spoken to Peter about these things and as she knew, neither had her husband. Apparently she didn't even know to what extent Peter had been informed.
Yesterday, when Margot, Peter and I were peeling potatoes, the conversation came naturally to Mof. "We still don't know what gender Mof is, do we?" I asked.
"Surely," he replied, "it's a hangover." I started laughing. 'Beautiful male who is expecting'. Peter and Margot laughed along at that funny mistake. Peter had noticed a month or two ago that it would not be long before Mof had children, her belly became remarkably thick. However, the thickness turned out to be from the many stolen bolts and the children did not grow fast, let alone that they were born.
Peter had to defend himself against that accusation. "No," he said, "You can come along to see him yourself, I saw very well, when I once ravaged with him, that he is a hangover."
I was unable to restrain my curiosity and went with him to the warehouse. However, Mof had no reception hour and was nowhere to be seen. We waited a while, got cold and took off all the stairs again. Later in the afternoon I heard him go down for the second time. I plucked up all my courage to walk through the quiet house alone, and ended up in the warehouse. On the packing table, Mof was playing with Peter, who put him on the scales to check his weight.
"Hello, do you want to see him?" He did not make long preparations, picked up the animal, turned it on its back, very deftly held head and paws, and the lesson began. 'This is the male genitalia, these are a few loose hairs and that is his posterior'. The cat made another half turn and stood on his white socks again.
Any other boy who would have shown me 'the male genitalia', I would not have looked at anymore.
But Peter simply talked on about the otherwise difficult subject, had no nasty ulterior motives at all and finally reassured me to the extent that I also became ordinary. We played with Mof, had fun, chatted together and then strolled through the vast warehouse to the door.
"I always find what I want to know by chance in some book, don't you?" I asked.
'Why, I ask above. My father knows that better than I do and has more experience in those things.'
We were already on the stairs and I kept my mouth shut.
'It can be,' Bredero said. Yes really, I would never have talked to a girl about it that ordinary. I'm also sure mom never meant this when she warned me about the boys. Despite everything, I was a bit out of my usual routine all day, when I thought about our conversation, it seemed strange to me. But at least on one point I have become wiser: there are also young people and still of the opposite sex, who can speak casually and without jokes.
Would Peter really ask his parents a lot, would he really be like that if he pretended to be yesterday?
Ah, what do I know about it!!! Your Anne.
Thursday, 27 January, 1944
Dear Kitty,
In recent times I have developed a strong love for family trees and genealogical tables of royal houses and have come to the conclusion that once one starts searching, one has to dig further and further into antiquity and come to more and more interesting discoveries.
Although I am extremely diligent, as far as my subjects are concerned, can already follow the home service of English radio fairly well, I still spend many Sundays sorting out and sorting out my large lmstar collection, which has taken on a very respectable size.
Mr. Kraler makes me happy every Monday, when he brings the Cinema & Theater. Although this indulgence is often described as a waste of money, by the unmundane housemates, they are always amazed at the accuracy, with which I can still name exactly the fellow players in a certain lm after a year. Elli, who often spends her days off with her boyfriend in the cinema, tells me the title of the intended lms on Saturdays and I rattle her off both the main interpreters and the criticism. It wasn't long ago that Mans said that I didn't have to go to the cinema later, because I had content, stars and criticism so well in my head.
When I come sailing one day with a new hairstyle on, they all look at me with disapproving faces and I can count on one to ask which lmster has this coiffure on her head. When I answer that it is their own invention, they only half believe me.
As for the hairstyle, which is not good for more than half an hour, then I am so tired of the dismissive judgments, that I rush to the bathroom and quickly restore my regular home, garden and kitchen hairstyle.
Your Anne.
Friday, 28 January, 1944
Dear Kitty,
This morning I wondered if you don't pretend to be like a cow, which all the
old news has to ruminate again and again and that of the one-sided food finally yawns hard and silently wishes that Anne pops up something new. Unfortunately, I know, the old is annoying for you, but imagine, how nagging
I get from the old cows, which are taken out of the ditch again and again. If a table conversation is not about politics or a delicious meal, mother or madam will come up with long-told childhood stories, or Dussel will talk about his wife's extensive wardrobe, beautiful racehorses, leaky rowing boats, boys swimming at four years old, muscle pain and anxious patients. The bottom line is that if one of the eight opens his mouth, the other seven can finish his story. We already know the pointe of each joke in advance and the narrator laughs alone at the wit. We already see the various milkmen, grocers and butchers of the ex-housewives in our imagination with a beard, so much they have been glorified or finished at the table; it is impossible that something is still young and fresh, when it is discussed in the Secret Annex.
All that would still be bearable, if the adults did not have such a hand in it, stories that Koophuis, Henk or Miep give dear, to tell ten times and each subsequent time decorate it with their own inventions, so that I often have to squeeze my arm under the table so as not to show the enthusiastic narrator the right way. Small children, as Anne is one, should not improve adults under any circumstances, whatever blunders they may make or what untruths and inventions they suck out of their thumb.
A subject that Koophuis and Henk often do justice to is hiding or going into hiding. They know very well that everything that relates to other people in hiding or hidden people is of burning interest to us and that we sincerely sympathize with arrested people in hiding in their suffering, as well as with liberated prisoners in their joy.
Hiding and hiding have become just as common a concept as dad's slippers used to be, which had to stand in front of the stove. Institutions such as 'Vrij Nederland', which forge identity cards, provide money to people in hiding, free up places to go into hiding, provide work for Christian boys in hiding, are many and it is amazing how much, how noble and how our selfless work is done by the people who use their own lives to help others and save others. Surely the best example of this is our helpers who have pulled us through so far and will hopefully put us all on dry land, otherwise they themselves will have to share the fate of all who are wanted. Never have we heard a single word that indicates the burden that we are surely, never does one of them complain that we are causing them too much trouble.
Every day they all come up, talk to the gentlemen about business and politics, with the ladies about food and the burdens of the wartime, with the children about books and newspapers. They put a happy face as much as possible, bring flowers and gifts for birthdays and holidays, are always and everywhere ready for us. That is what we must never forget, that although others show heroism in the war or towards the Germans, our helpers show heroism in their cheerfulness and love.
The craziest talk is doing the rounds and yet the facts have usually actually happened. Koophuis informed us this week, for example, that in Gelderland two teams played against each other, one consisted exclusively of people in hiding and the second was composed of eleven members of the marechaussée. In Hilversum, new pedigree cards are issued. So that the many people in hiding also get their share of the rationing, officials of the award ceremony have ordered all people in hiding from the vicinity at a certain hour, so that they can pick up their documents at a separate table. You have to be careful that such samples do not come to the attention of the mufflers.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
The invasion mood is rising in the country by the day and if you were here, you would certainly be impressed on the one hand like me by all those preparations, but on the other hand you would laugh at us, because we make such a fuss, who knows for nothing.
All the newspapers are full of the invasion and drive the people crazy, because they write: 'If the English would possibly land in the Netherlands, the German authorities will do everything in their power to defend the country, if necessary also flood it'. In addition, maps have been published on which the parts of the Netherlands, which can be flooded, are shaded. Since large parts of Amsterdam belong to the shaded, the first question was what to do if the water is a meter high in the streets.
To this difficult question came the most different answers from all sides:
'Because etching or walking is out of the question, we will then have to wade through the stagnant water'.
'Well, one should try to swim. We all put on a swimming cap and swimsuit and swim underwater as much as possible, then nobody sees that we are Jews.'
'Oh, what a talk, I can already see the ladies swimming, when the rats bite their legs!' (That was a man, of course, seeing who screams the loudest!)
'We won't be able to leave the house anymore, the warehouse is so shaky that it will definitely collapse in such a flood'.
'Hear guys, now all the craziness on a stick, we'll get a boat'.
'Why is that necessary? I know something much better, we each take a milk sugar box from the attic and row with a ladle'.
'I'm going to walk stilts, I could do that in my youth primissima'.
'Henk van Santen doesn't need that, he certainly takes his wife on his back, then Miep has stilts'.
Now you pretty much know, don't Kit? This chatter is all very funny; the truth will tell otherwise.
The second invasion question was inevitable. What to do if the Germans evacuate Amsterdam?
'Go along, disguise ourselves as best we can'.
'Don't go along under any circumstances. All it's to stay here! The Germans are able to drive the entire population back further and further, until they die in Germany.'
'Yes of course, we stay here, here it is the safest. We will try to persuade Koophuis to come and live here with his family. We will see if we get a bag of wood wool, then we can sleep on the floor. Let Miep and Koophuis bring blankets here'.
"We will order some grain at our 60 pounds. Let Henk get legumes, we now have about 60 pounds of beans and 10 pounds of peas in the house. Don't forget the 50 cans of vegetables'. 'Mother, count the other foods!' '10 Cans of fish, 40 cans of milk, 10 kg of milk powder, 3 ash oil, 4 jars of butter, 4 ditto meat, 2 basket of ash strawberries, 2 ash raspberry berries, 20 ash tomatoes, 10 pounds of oatmeal, 8 pounds of rice, that's it.".
'Our stock is not too bad, but when you consider that we will still have to feed visitors and it is used every week, then it seems more enormous than it is. Coal and firewood are sufficient in the house, candles too. Let's all sew breast pockets, to take all our money with us if necessary.
We will make lists of what should be taken first during flights and now grab backpacks. When the time comes, we put two lookouts on guard, one on the front and one on the rear loft. Say, what do we do with so much food if we don't have water, gas and electricity?'
'Then we have to cook on the stove. Draining water and boiling. We will clean large basket ash trees and store water in them.'
I hear these talk all day long, invasion before, invasion after, disputes about starvation, dying, bombs, fire hoses, sleeping bags, Jew certificates, poison gases and so on and so forth. None of this is exciting. A good example of the unequivocal warnings of the gentlemen from the Secret Annex is the following conversation with Henk:
Achterhuis: 'We are afraid that the Germans, if they withdraw, will take the entire population with them'.
Henk: 'That is not possible, they do not have trains available for that'.
A.: "Trains? Did you think they would also put the citizens in a cart? No matter, they can use the leg carriage'. (Per pedes apostolorum, Dussel always says.)
H.: 'I don't believe any of it, you see everything through far too black glasses. What interest would they have in driving all citizens along?'
A.: 'Do you not know that Goebbels said: 'If we have to withdraw, we will slam the door of all the occupied territories behind us?'
H.: 'They've already said so much'.
A.: "Do you think that the Germans are too noble or too humane for such an act? They think: "If we have to perish, then all the people who are within the reach of our power will also perish".
H.: "You can tell me a lot, I don't believe any of it!"
A.: 'It's always the same song; no one wants to see the danger that threatens him before it has touched his own body."
H.: 'You don't know anything positive either; you assume so anyway'. A.: 'We all experienced it ourselves, first in Germany and then here. And what happens in Russia?'
H.: 'You have to leave the Jews aside for a moment, I believe that no one knows what is going on in Russia. The English and Russians, like the Germans, will exaggerate for propaganda purposes.
A.: "No matter, English radio has always told the truth. And suppose the reports are exaggerated, then the facts are still bad enough, because you cannot deny that it is a fact that in Poland and Russia many millions of peaceful people are murdered or gassed without much detours.'
Furthermore, I will spare you our conversations, I am very calm and do not care about all the hustle and bustle. I've gotten to the point where I don't really care anymore if I die or stay alive. The world continues to turn without me and I can't resist the events anyway.
I let it come to fruition and do nothing but learn and hope for a good ending.
Your Anne.
Saturday, 12 February, 1944
Dear Kitty,
The sun is shining, the sky is deep blue, there is a wonderful wind blowing and I long so -, long so - for everything ..... To talk, to freedom, to friends, to being alone. I desire so ... to cry! I have a feeling in me like I'm jumping and I know it would get better with crying; I can't do it. I am restless, walking from one room to another, breathing through the crack of a closed window, feeling my heart beating, as if saying: 'Finally satisfy my desire'.
I believe that I feel spring in me, I feel the spring awakening, I feel it in my whole body and in my soul. I have to restrain myself to just do it, I'm totally confused, don't know what to read, what to write, what to do, just know, that I desire...!
Your Anne.
Sunday, 13 February, 1944
Dear Kitty,
A lot has changed for me since Saturday. Here's why. I desired - and I still desire - but ... for a small, very small part I have already been helped. Sunday morning I already noticed - I'll be honest - to my great joy that Peter looked at me like this all the time. So very different than usual, I don't know, I can't explain how.
I used to think that Peter was in love with Margot, now I suddenly had the feeling that this is not the case. The whole day I deliberately did not look at him much, because when I did, he always looked and then -, yes, then I got a feeling in me, which I should not get too often.
I have a strong need to be alone. Father notices that I'm not used to it, but I can't tell him everything either. 'Leave me alone, leave me alone!' that's what I would like to exclaim all the time. Who knows, maybe I'll be left alone more than I like!
Your Anne.
Monday, 14 February 1944
Dear Kitty,
Sunday evening they were all on the radio, except Pim and I, listening to the 'Unsterbliche Musik Deutscher Meister'. Dussel was constantly turning the device. Peter was annoyed and so were the others. After half an hour of restrained nervousness, Peter, somewhat stimulated, requested that the twisting be stopped. Dussel replied in his haughtiest tone: 'Ich mach' das schon'. Peter became angry, became brutal, Mr. Van Daan joined him and Dussel had to give in. That was it.
The reason in itself was not that extraordinarily important, but it seems that Peter was very concerned about the matter. In any case, this morning, when I was rummaging in the bookcase in the attic, he came to me and started to tell me the matter. I knew nothing about it, Peter noticed that he had found an attentive listener, and got going.
"Yes, and you see," he said, "I don't say anything anytime soon, because I already know ahead that I will not get out of my words. I stutter, get a color and turn the words I wanted to say around, until I have to break my claims, because I can't find the words myself anymore. Yesterday it was the same for me, I wanted to say something completely different, but once I started, I lost my mind and that's terrible. I used to have a bad habit, which I would prefer to apply now. If I was angry with someone, I'd rather work them with my fists than argue with them. I do know that I will not get any further with this method and that is why I admire you, at least you come straight out of your words, tell people what you have to say and are in the least not shy.'
'Then you are very mistaken', I replied, 'in most cases I say things very differently than I originally intended and then I talk way too much and for far too long, that is just as bad a disease'.
In silence I had to laugh at this last sentence, but I wanted to let him speak about himself, did not let him notice my cheerfulness, sat on a pillow on the floor, wrapped my arms around my raised legs and looked at him attentively.
I am very happy that there is still someone in the house who can have exactly the same tantrums as I do. Peter was visibly pleased that he was allowed to criticize Dussel in the worst terms, without having to be afraid of clicking. And I, I found it too, because I noticed a strong sense of community, which I used to only have with my girlfriends.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 16 February, 1944
Dear Kitty,
It's Margot's birthday.
At half past one Peter came to see the presents and kept talking much longer than was absolutely necessary, which he would never have done otherwise. In the afternoon I went to get the kof e and then got the potatoes, because I wanted to spoil Margot once a year. I came through Peter's room, he immediately took all his papers off the stairs and I asked if I should close the hatch to the loft. "Yes," he replied, "just do that. If you come back, knock you, I'll open it for you.'
I thanked him, went upstairs and searched for the smallest potatoes from the big barrel for ten minutes. Then I got pain in my back and got cold. Of course I didn't knock, opened the hatch myself, but he still met me very obligingly and tackled the pan. "I searched for a long time, I couldn't find a smaller one," I said.
"Have you looked into the big barrel?"
'Yes, I put my hands tossed everything around'.
In the meantime I was at the bottom of the stairs and he looked inquisitively into the pan, which he still held in his hands. "Oh, but they're good," he said, adding, when I took over the pan from him, "My compliment, hear!" He looked at me with such a warm, soft look that I also became warm and soft inside. I could so really tell that he wanted to please me and because he could not give a big eulogy, he put his words in his gaze. I understood him oh so well and was very grateful to him. Even now, I am happy when I remember the words and that look.
When I came downstairs, mother told me to get more potatoes, now for dinner. I very willingly offered to go upstairs again.
When I came to Peter, I apologized for disturbing him again. He got up, stood between the stairs and the wall, grabbed my arm when I was already on the stairs and wanted to stop me with all force. "I'll go," he said. I replied that this was not necessary and that I did not have to get a small one now. Then he was convinced and let go of my arm. On the way back he came to open the hatch and picked up the pan from me again. At the door, I asked, "What are you doing?" 'French', was the answer. I asked if I could look into the lessons, washed my hands and sat down opposite him on the couch.
After I had explained something to him from French, we soon started talking. He told me that he wanted to go to the Dutch East Indies later and live in the plantations there. He talked about his life at home, about the black-trading and that he was such a useless person. I said that he had a very strong sense of inferiority. He also spoke of the Jews. He would have found it much easier if he were a Christian and if he could be a Christian after the war. I asked if he wanted to be baptized, but he wasn't. After the war, no one would know whether he was a Christian or a Jew, he said.
In addition, I took a stab through the heart, I think it is such a pity that he still has a residual dishonesty in him. Furthermore, we talked very nicely about father and about people knowledge and about all possible things, I don't remember what myself.
At half past five I left.
In the evening he said something else, which I liked. We were talking about an lmster that he once got from me and that has been hanging in his room for at least a year and a half now. He liked it so much and I offered to give him some other lmstars.
"No," he replied, "I'd rather leave it that way; this one here, I look at it every day and they have become my friends'.
Why he always presses Mouschi against himself, I now also understand better. Of course, he also needs tenderness.
I forgot something else he talked about. He said, "I don't know fear; only when something is wrong with me. But I'm already learning that'.
Peter's feeling of inferiority is very bad. For example, he always thinks that he is so stupid and we are so handsome. When I help him with Frans, he thanks a thousand times. I will definitely say: 'Get rid of those talks, you know English and geography much better'.
Your Anne.
Friday, 18 February 1944
Dear Kitty,
If I go up, whenever, it always has the goal that I will see 'him'.
So my life here has actually gotten much better, because it now has a purpose again and I can look forward to something.
At least the object of my friendship is always in the house and, except for Margot, I don't have to be afraid of rivals. Do not think that I am in love, that is not true, but I always have the feeling that something beautiful will grow between Peter and me, something that is friendship and gives confidence. If possible, I go to him and it's not like he used to be, that he doesn't know what to do with me. On the contrary, he still talks when I'm almost out the door.
Mother doesn't like me to go upstairs, she always says that I'm bothering Peter and that I should leave him alone. Wouldn't she really understand that I still have intuition?
Whenever I go inside the small room, she looks at me so crazy. When I come from top to bottom, she asks where I have been. I can't have that and I mind.
Your Anne.
Saturday, 19 February, 1944
Dear Kitty,
It's Saturday again and that in itself says enough.
The morning was quiet. I helped a bit upstairs, but I didn't speak to 'him' more than fleetingly. When at half past three all had looked for their rooms either to read or to sleep, I went with blanket and all to the private office downstairs to sit at the writing table reading or writing. It didn't take very long, then it became too powerful for me, my head fell forward on my arm and I sobbed it out. The tears flowed and I felt deeply unhappy. Oh, if only 'he' had come to comfort me. It was already four o'clock when I went back upstairs. I picked up potatoes with new hope in my heart for a meeting, but when I was still in the bathroom dosing my hair, he went to Mof in the warehouse.
Suddenly I felt the tears rise again and rushed to the W.C., quickly grabbing the hand mirror on the way. There I was now, fully dressed, with my tears making dark spots on the red of my apron and I was deeply saddened.
I kind of thought, "Oh, I'll never reach Peter like that. Who knows, maybe he doesn't like me at all and doesn't need trust. Maybe he never thinks of me more than superficially. I have to move on alone again, without trust and without Peter. Perhaps soon again without hope, comfort and expectation. Oh, if only I could now rub my head against his shoulder and not feel so hopelessly alone and abandoned! Who knows, maybe he doesn't care about me at all and he looks at the others so softly. Did I perhaps imagine that this was for me? Oh Peter, if only you could hear or see me. But the truth, which is perhaps so disappointing, I could not bear."
But a little later I felt hopeful and full of expectation again, while the tears still flowed in me.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 23 February, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Since yesterday it is wonderful weather outside and I am completely refreshed. I go almost every morning to the attic where Peter works to let the stuffy room air blow out of my lungs. From my favorite spot on the ground I look at the blue sky, at the bare chestnut tree on whose branches small droplets sparkle, at the gulls and the other birds, which in their flyby look like silver.
He stood with his head leaning against the thick beam, I sat, we breathed into the air, looked outside and felt that this was something not to interrupt with words. We looked outside for a long time and when he had to go to chop wood on the loft, I knew he was a guy. He climbed the stairs, I followed and during the quarter of an hour that he chopped wood we did not speak a word again. I watched him from my position, how he visibly did his best to chop well, to show his strength to me. But I also looked out the open window, over a large part of Amsterdam, over all the roofs to the horizon, which was so light blue that the dividing line was not clearly visible. 'As long as this still exists', I thought 'and I can experience it, this sunshine, that sky of which there is no cloud, I cannot be sad for so long'.
For anyone who is afraid, lonely or unhappy, the best way is to go outside, somewhere where he is all alone, alone with heaven, nature and God. Because only then, only then one feels that everything is as it should be and that God wants to see people happy in the simple, but beautiful nature. As long as this exists, and it always will, I know that in whatever circumstances, there is a consolation for every sorrow. And I firmly believe that with every misery, nature can take away a lot of bad things.
Oh, who knows, maybe it won't be long before I can share this overwhelming feeling of happiness with someone who is going through it just like me.
Your Anne.
Thought:
We miss a lot, a lot and a very long time here and I miss it just like you. I'm not talking about outer things, we're provided with that here, no, I mean the inner things. Like you, I long for freedom and air, but now I believe that we have received ample compensation for these hardships. I suddenly realized this when I was sitting in front of the window this morning. I mean compensation inside.
When I looked outside and actually looked straight and deep at God and nature, then I was happy, no different than happy. And Peter, as long as there is that happiness inside, that happiness for nature, health and much more, as long as one carries that with one, one will always be happy again.
Wealth, prestige, everything can lose you, but that happiness in your own heart can only be veiled, and will make you happy again and again, as long as you live. As long as you can fearlessly look up to Heaven, as long as you know that you are pure inside and that you will be happy again.
Sunday, 27 February, 1944
Dearest Kitty,
From early in the morning until late at night, I don't really do anything but think of Peter. I sleep with his image in front of me, dream of him and wake up again when he still looks at me.
I have a strong feeling that Peter and I are not as different as it seems from the outside and I will also explain why. Peter and I both miss a mother. His is too superficial, likes to irt and doesn't care much about his thoughts. Mine interferes with me, but lacks the jne feeling, the motherly understanding.
Peter and I both struggle with our insides, we are both still insecure and actually too delicate and too soft inward to be dealt with harshly. If they do, my reaction to that is the urge to 'want out'. But because that is impossible, I hide my insides, throw pans and water and am noisy, so that everyone just wished I was gone.
On the other hand, he locks himself up, hardly speaks, is silent, dreams and therefore hides himself jealously.
But how and when will we finally reach each other?
I don't know how long I can control this desire with my mind. Your Anne.
Monday, 28 February 1944
Dearest Kitty,
It becomes a night and day mare. I see him almost every hour and can't get to him, I'm not allowed to show anything, I have to be cheerful, while inside me everything is desperate.
Peter Wessel and Peter van Daan have merged into one Peter, who is good and sweet and whom I desperately long for.
Mother is difficult, father sweet and therefore even more difficult, Margot the most difficult, because she claims a sweet face and I want to have peace.
Peter didn't come to my attic, he went to the loft and did some carpentry there. With every crackle and every blow, a piece of my courage crumbled and I became even sadder. And in the distance a bell played: 'Upright of body, upright of soul!' I'm sentimental, - I know. I am desperate and unwise, - I know that too.
O help me! Your Anne.
Wednesday, 1 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
My own affairs have been pushed into the background and ... by a burglary. I get annoying with my burglaries, but what can I do about it, that the burglars have such a pleasure in honoring Kolen & Co. with a visit? This burglary is much more complicated than the previous one of July 1943.
When Mr. Van Daan went to Kraler's office last night as usual at half past eight, he saw the glass connecting doors and the office door open. This amazed him, he walked on and became more and more amazed, when the cabinet doors were also opened and there was a terrible mess in the front office. 'Here was a thief', it iteched through his head and to be sure of the case he walked down the stairs, examined the front door, felt the Lips lock, everything was closed. "Oh, then both Peter and Elli must have been very sloppy tonight," he now assumed. He stayed in Kraler's room for a while, then turned off the lamp, went upstairs, and worried neither about the open doors nor about the cluttered front office.
This morning Peter knocked on our room door early and came with the less pleasant news, that the front door was wide open. He also managed to tell that the projection device and Kraler's new actetas had disappeared from the wall cabinet. Peter was ordered to close the door, Van Daan told his experiences from the previous evening and we were very worried.
The whole case can only be explained that the thief has a fake key to the door, because it was not broken open at all. He must have sneaked in here very early in the evening, closed the door behind him and hid by Van Daan, until he had left and then fled with his loot, leaving the door open in a hurry. Who can have our key? Why didn't the thief go to the warehouse? Would perhaps one of our own warehouse men be the culprit and would he not betray us now, since he heard Van Daan and maybe even saw him?
It's very creepy, because we don't know if the burglar in question won't get it in his head to open our door again. Or would he perhaps have been shocked himself by the man who walked around here?
Your Anne.
Thursday, 2 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Margot and I were upstairs in the attic today; although I can't enjoy her as much as I imagined, I know that she feels the same way as I do on most things.
At the dishes, Elli started talking to mother and Mrs. Van Daan about her discouragement. How do those two help her?
Do you know what mother gave her for advice? She just had to think of all those other people who are going through in this world! Who helps the thought of misery now, if he himself is already miserable? I also said this, the answer was: 'You can't talk about such things'.
How idiotic and stupid the adults are! As if Peter, Margot, Elli and I don't all feel the same and against that only motherly love or love from very, very good friends helps. But those mothers here don't have that little understanding of us yet. Mrs. Van Daan perhaps a little more than mother. Oh, I would have loved to have said something to poor Elli, something that I know from experience helps. But father intervened and pushed me aside.
How stupid they all are! We must not judge. Yes, they are terribly modern. Have no judgment! One can say, you have to keep your mouth shut, but there is no such thing as having no judgment. No one can forbid another person's judgment, even if that other person is still so young.
For Elli, Margot, Peter and me, only a great and devoted love helps, which all four of us don't get. And no one, especially those idiot sages here can understand us, because we are much more sensitive and much further along with our thoughts than anyone from here would even remotely suspect.
At the moment mother is grumbling again; she is visibly jealous, because nowadays I talk more with Mrs. Van Daan than with her.
This afternoon I got hold of Peter, we talked together for at least three quarters of an hour. Peter had a lot of trouble telling something of himself, it came very slowly. He said his parents argued so often about politics, cigarettes and all sorts of more. He was very shy.
I would tell him about my parents. He defended his father: he thought he was a 'murderer'. Then we talked about downstairs and upstairs; he was really a bit surprised that we still don't like his parents. "Peter," I said, "you know I'm being honest, why shouldn't I tell you, we know their mistakes anyway." Among other things, I said: 'Peter, I would like to help you so much, can't I? You're so caught up in this and I know, even if you don't say it, that you still care about it.'
"Oh, I would always like to use your help." 'Maybe it's better to go to your father, he won't tell you anything else, you can tell him, you know!'
'Yes, he is a real comrade'.
"You love him a lot, don't you?" Peter nodded and I continued, "Well, he's yours too!"
He looked up quickly and red, it was really touching how happy he was with those few words.
"Do you think?" he asked.
'Yes', I said, 'you can tell from what he occasionally lets go!' Peter, just like father, is also a 'murderer'!
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
When I looked into the candle tonight1., I became happy and calm again. Grandma is actually in that candle and Grandma is too, who protects and shelters me and who makes me happy again.
But... there is another, who controls my whole mood and that is ... Godfather. When I got the potatoes today and was still standing on the stairs with the full pan, he already asked: 'What did you do in the afternoon?'
I sat down on the stairs and we started talking. At a quarter past five (an hour after fetching) the potatoes, which I had put on the floor in the meantime, only arrived in the room.
Peter didn't say a word about his parents anymore, we only talked about books and about the past. What a warm look that boy has; it doesn't make much difference, I believe, if I fall in love with him. That's what he was talking about tonight. I came in to him, after peeling potatoes, and said that I was so hot.
"You can see the temperature from Margot and me, when it's cold we're white, when it's hot we're red," I said.
"In love?" he asked.
"Why should I be in love?" My answer was pretty silly.
"Why not!" he said, and then we had to eat.
Would he have meant anything by that question? I finally got around to asking him today if he didn't find my chatting difficult, he just said: 'I think it's good, hear!'
To what extent this answer is now shy, I cannot judge.
Kitty, I'm like a lover, who knows nothing else to say but her treasure. Peter is indeed a treasure. When could I tell him that? Of course only if he also finds me a treasure, but I am not a kitten to handle without gloves, I know that. And he loves his peace, so to what extent he likes me, I have no idea. In any case, we get to know each other a bit, I just wish we would dare to come out for many more things. Who knows, maybe that time will come sooner than I think! About a few times a day I get a look of rapport from him, I wink back and we are both happy.
I seem crazy to talk about his happiness, but I have the irresistible feeling that he thinks the same way I do.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
For months and months, this Saturday has not been as annoying, sad and boring as all the previous ones. None other than Peter is the cause of this.
This morning I came to hang my apron in the attic, when father asked if I would not stay to speak some French. I thought it was good, we spoke some French first, I explained something to Peter, then we did English. Father read from Dickens and I was too rich in heaven, because I was sitting in my father's chair close to Peter.
At 11 o'clock I went down. When I came back upstairs at half past 12, he was already waiting for me on the stairs. We talked up to a quarter to one. If it only comes in handy, when I leave the house, for example after dinner, when no one hears it, he says: 'Hi Anne, see you later'.
Oh, I'm so happy! Would he love me now? In any case, he is a nice guy and who knows how I can talk to him!
She thinks it's fine, when I talk to him, but today she teasingly asked: 'Can I trust the two of you up there?'
"Of course," I said protesting. "You're insulting me, you know!"
I look forward to seeing Peter from morning to evening. Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
I can see from Peter's face that he thinks as much as I do, and last night I was annoyed when mrs. said so mockingly: 'The thinker!' Peter turned red and shy and I was jumping.
Let those people keep their mouths shut!
You can't imagine how sad it is to look idly at how lonely he is. I can imagine, as if I had experienced it myself, how desperate he must sometimes be at quarrels and love. Poor Peter, how much he needs love!
How loud it sounded to my ears, when he spoke of it, that he did not need friends. Oh, how wrong he is! I also believe that he does not mean any of those words!
He clings to his loneliness, his made indifference and his maturity not to fall out of his role, to never, ever show how he feels. Poor Peter, how long can this role last? Won't that superhuman effort be followed by a terrible outburst?
Oh Peter, if only I could and should help you! We together would both dispel our loneliness!
I think a lot, but don't say much. I am happy when I see him and when the sun is still shining. Yesterday I was very excited about the main washing; I knew he was sitting in the room next to us. I couldn't help it, the quieter and more serious I am on the inside, the noisier I am on the outside.
Who will be the first to discover and break through this armor? It is good that the Van Daans do not have a girl, never could my conquest be so difficult, so beautiful and so jn, if not just the opposite sex would attract.
Your Anne.
P.S. You know that I honestly write everything to you, that's why I have to tell you that I actually live from one encounter to another. I always hope to discover that he is also waiting for me and I am delighted in myself when I notice his small shy attempts. I think he would love to come out of his words as much as I do; he also does not know that it is precisely his awkwardness that strikes me.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
When I think about my life in 1942, it all feels so unreal. This life of the gods experienced a very different Anne than the one who has now become wise here. A life of the gods, that was it. At every corner worshippers, about twenty friends and acquaintances, the darling of the majority of teachers, spoiled by father and mother from top to bottom, lots of candy, enough money, what more could you want?
You will probably want to ask me how I have taken all those people in. What Peter says: 'Attractiveness', is not entirely true. Every teacher found my clever answers, my funny comments, my smiling face and my critical look fun, amusing and funny. That's all I was; a terrible irt, coquet and amusing. I had a few advantages, which kept me fairly in favor, namely diligence, honesty and generosity. I would never have refused anyone to look away, I distributed sweets with a large hand and I was not conceited.
Wouldn't all that admiration have made me overconfident? It is one lucky thing that in the middle of the party, at the height of the party, I suddenly found myself in reality, and it took more than a year before I was used to it, that there was no longer any admiration anywhere.
How did they see me at school? The leader in jokes and jokes, always in the front, never in a bad mood or crying. Was it any wonder that everyone liked to etch with me or show me a gift?
I look down on that Anne, as if she was a nice, but very superficial girl, who has nothing to do with me anymore. Peter quite rightly said about me: 'When I saw you, you were invariably surrounded by two or more boys and a bunch of girls. You always laughed and you were the center of attention!'
What is left of this girl? Oh sure, I haven't forgotten my laughter and my answers yet, I can still criticize people just as well or even better, I can still iride, if I ... will. That's where it is, I sometimes want to live like this for an evening, a few days, a week, seemingly carefree and cheerful. But at the end of that week, I would be exhausted and very grateful to the first one who would talk about something decent. I don't want worshippers, but friends, not admirers for a flattering laugh, but for performance and character. I know very well that the circle around me would be much smaller. But what hinders that, if I only have a few people left, sincere people?
Despite everything, I was not entirely happy in 1942; I often felt abandoned, but because I was busy from morning to evening, I didn't think twice and had fun as much as I could. Consciously or unconsciously, I tried to dispel the emptiness with jokes. Now I look at my own life and work. One era of it has been irrevocably closed. The carefree, carefree school time will never come back.
I don't even long for it anymore, I've grown out of it, I can't just have fun, a part of me always keeps its seriousness.
I see my life until New Year 1944 as under a sharp microscope. At home life with a lot of sun, then in 1942 here, the sudden transition, the quarrels, the accusations. I couldn't grasp it, I was caught off guard and knew nothing else to maintain my attitude but brutality.
The first half of 1943; my crying fits, the loneliness, the slow realization of all those mistakes and flaws, which are so big and seemed twice as big. I talked about everything during the day, tried to pull Pim towards me; it didn't work. I was faced with the difficult task of making myself so that I would no longer hear any reproaches, because they pushed me down to a terrible despondency.
The second half of the year it got a little better, I became fryfish, was considered more of an adult. I started thinking, writing stories and came to the conclusion that the others no longer had the right to pull me from left to right like a pendulum ball. I wanted to reform myself according to my own will. But one thing that touched me even more was that I realized that father would never become my trusted in everything. I didn't want to trust anyone more than myself.
After New Year: the second big change, my dream ... With that I discovered my desire for a boy; not to a girl friend, but to a boy-friend. Also discovered the happiness in myself and my armor of superficiality and cheerfulness. At times I became silent, discovered my boundless desire for everything beautiful and good.
And in the evening, when I lie in bed and my prayer ends with the words, "I thank you for all the Good and Dear and Beautiful," it rejoices in me. Then I think of 'the Good' of going into hiding, of my health and my whole self, of 'the Dear' of Peter, that which is still small and sensitive and what we both do not yet dare to call or touch, that which will one day come, love, the future, happiness and 'the Beautiful' that is the world; the world, nature, beauty and all, all the beautiful together.
Then I don't think of all the misery, but of the beauty that remains. This is to a large extent the difference between mother and me. Her advice for melancholy is: 'Think of all the misery in the world and be glad that you do not experience it!' My advice is, "Go outside, to the fields, nature and the sun, go outside and try to find happiness in yourself and in God. Think of all the beauty that remains in and around yourself and be happy!'
I don't think mother's sentence can hold, because what should you do when you experience the misery yourself? Then you're lost. On the other hand, I think that there is still something beautiful left, about nature, the sunshine, the freedom, about yourself, that's useful. Look at that, then you find yourself again and God, then you become balanced.
And whoever is happy will also make others happy, whoever has courage and confidence will never suffer in misery!
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
Lately I don't have any sitting meat anymore; I walk from top to bottom and back again. I think it's okay to talk to Peter, but I'm always afraid that I'm bothering him. He told me a thing or two about the past, his parents and himself. I think it's far too little and I wonder how I can come to desire more. He used to find me insufferable; it went vice versa, now I have changed my mind, must he have changed?
I think so, but that does not mean that we have to become good friends, although from my side I could carry the whole hiding lighter. But don't let me get upset; I keep myself busy with him enough and don't have to make you sad with me, because I feel so lame.
Saturday afternoon, after a row of sad messages from outside, I was so turned on that I lay down on my couch to sleep. I wanted nothing but sleep so as not to have to think. I slept until four o'clock, then had to go inside. It was very difficult for me to answer mother to all her questions and to come up with an excuse for father, which explained my sleep. I pretended to have a headache, which was not a lie, since I also had a headache ... inside!
Ordinary people, ordinary girls, fry fish like me, will find me ticked in my self-pity. But yes, that's right, I tell you everything that is on my heart and am as bold, cheerful and self-aware as possible for the rest of the day, to avoid all questions and not to annoy myself internally.
Margot is very sweet and would like to be my trusted, I can't tell her everything. She is sweet and good and beautiful, but she lacks the nonchalance to talk about deeper things; she takes me seriously, way too seriously and thinks about her crazy sister for a long time, looks at me inquisitively at everything I say and thinks about everything: 'Is it comedy now or does she really mean it?' That's because we're together all the time and I couldn't have my trust around me all the time.
When will I come out of that muddle of thoughts, when will there be peace and tranquility in me again?
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 14 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
It may be entertaining for you - not for me at all - to hear what we will be eating today. At the moment, since the worker is downstairs, I am sitting at the tarpaulin table at the Van Daans, have pushed a handkerchief into my mouth and against my nose, which is drenched in fragrant pre-diving perfume. You won't understand much of it that way, so again:
'Start at the beginning'.
Since our voucher suppliers have been arrested, we have, except for our five food cards, no extra vouchers and no fat. Since both Miep and Koophuis are ill, Elli can't do any shopping and since the whole mood is gloomy, so is the food. From tomorrow we will no longer have a chunk of fat, butter or margarine. We no longer have breakfast with baked potatoes (bread saving), but with porridge and since mrs thinks we are starving, we have clandestinely bought whole milk. Our lunch today is kale stew from the barrel. Hence the precaution with the handkerchief. Unsatisfactory as kale can stink, if it is a year old. It smells here in the room of a mixture of spoiled plums, sharp preservative and rotten eggs. Bah, I already get nauseous at the mere idea that I have to eat that junk.
In addition, our potatoes have contracted such strange diseases that one of two buckets of pommes de terre ends up in the stove. We enjoy figuring out exactly the different diseases and have come to the conclusion that cancer, smallpox and measles alternate. Oh no, it is no fun to be in hiding in the fourth year of the war. If only all that crap had ended!
Honestly, I wouldn't care so much about all the food, if only it were a bit more enjoyable here. There's the rub: all of us are starting to make this boring life a mess.
Here is the opinion of five adult people in hiding about the current situation:
Mrs. Van Daan:
'I don't like the job of kitchen princess for a long time. Sitting and not having anything in hand bored, so I cook again. Still, I have to complain, cooking without fat is impossible, I get nauseous from all those foul smells. Nothing but ingratitude and shouting is the reward for my effort; I am always the black sheep, I am blamed for everything. Furthermore, my view is that the war does not make much progress, the Germans will still bear the victory after all. I'm terribly afraid that we'll starve and I'll kill everyone if I'm in a bad mood.'
Mr. Van Daan:
"I have to smoke, smoke, smoke, then food, politics, Kerli's mood is not so bad. Kerli is a lovely woman'.
But if he doesn't get anything to smoke, nothing is good, then one hears: 'I get sick, we live too badly, I have to have meat. Terribly stupid man, that Kerli of mine!' After that, there will certainly be a high-pitched quarrel.
Mrs. Frank:
'The food is not very important, but now I would like to have a slice of rye bread, because I am terribly hungry.
If I were Mrs Van Daan, I would have put a stop to the perpetual smoking of mr. long ago. But now I definitely have to have a cigarette, because my zenu wen are the boss.
The English make a lot of mistakes, but the war is progressing, I have to talk and be glad I'm not in Poland.'
Mr. Frank:
"All right, don't need anything. Calm down, we have the time. Give me my potatoes and I'll keep my mouth shut. Quickly set aside something for Elli from my ration. Politics is doing an excellent job, I'm very optimistic!'
Mr. Dussel:
'I have to get my pensum to finish everything in time. Politically "oitschtekent", that we are caught is "unmooglijk".
Me, me, I,..!' Your Anne.
Wednesday, 15 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Pf, hey, huh, freed from the gloomy pre-scenes for a moment!
I hear nothing today but 'if this and that happens, then we will have difficulties with that and if he still gets sick, we will be alone in the world, and if then ...' And one, the rest you know, at least I suspect that you know the Achterhuizers enough by now to be able to guess their conversations.
The reason for the 'if, if' is that Mr. Kraler has been called to dig, Elli has a cold more than a snipe and will probably have to stay at home tomorrow, Miep has not yet been cured of her flu and Koophuis has had a stomach hemorrhage with unconsciousness. A true sad list!
The warehouse people have been given a day off tomorrow; if Elli stays at home, the door remains locked and we have to be quiet so that the neighbors don't hear us. Henk then comes to visit the abandoned at one o'clock and plays, as it were, the role of Artis babysitter. This afternoon, for the first time in a long time, he told us something about the big world. You should have seen the eight of us sitting around him, it looked like a picture: When grandmother is telling. - He chatted a hundred times in front of his grateful audience, of course about the food and then about Miep's doctor, which we asked him about. "Doctor, don't talk me out of the doctor! I called him this morning, got an assistant on the phone and asked for a prescription for the flu. The answer was that I could come and get a recipe between eight and nine in the morning. If you have a very bad flu, the doctor himself comes on the phone and says, "Stick out your tongue, say aah. I can already hear it, you have a red throat. I will write a prescription for you, you can order at the pharmacy, bye sir."' And with that basta. Easy practice is that, only operation by telephone.
But let me not blame the doctors, after all, every human being has only two hands, and in the present tense there is an abundance of patients and a minimum number of doctors. Yet we all laughed for a moment when Henk made that phone call.
I can really imagine what a doctor's waiting room looks like these days. People no longer look down on bus patients, but on people who have nothing bad wrong and think: 'Man, what do you have to look for here, at the back of the queue, hear, bad patients have priority'.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 16 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
The weather is lovely, indescribably beautiful; I'll go to the attic soon. Now I know why I am so much more restless than Peter. He has his own room where he works, dreams, thinks and sleeps. I am pushed from one corner to another. Alone in my shared room I am almost never and yet I long for it so much. That is why I flee to the attic so often. There and with you I can be myself for a moment, just for a moment. Yet I do not want to whine about my desire, on the contrary, I want to be courageous. Fortunately, the others can't notice anything about my inner feelings, except that by the day I am cooler towards mother, father less affectionate and also towards Margot nothing more let go. I'm pot-tight. Above all, I must keep my outer certainty, no one should know that there is still war in me. War between my desire and mind. So far, the latter has won, but won't the former turn out to be the strongest, right? Sometimes I fear and often I do!
Oh, it's so terribly hard never to let go of anything in front of Peter, but I know he has to start first; it is so difficult to have to undo all those conversations and actions that I have experienced in my dreams during the day! Yes Kitty, Anne is a crazy child, but I also live in a crazy time and in even crazier circumstances.
The worst thing of all I still think is that I can at least write down what I think and feel, otherwise I would completely suffocate! What does Peter think about all these things? Again and again I hope that one day I will be able to talk to him about it. There must be something he guessed from me, because he can't love the external Anne, whom he knows so far.
How can he, who loves peace and quiet so much, feel sympathy for my noise and busyness? Can he be the first and only one in the world to look behind my concrete mask? Will he soon end up behind it? Isn't there an old saying that love often follows pity, or that the two go hand in hand? Isn't that also the case with me? Because I feel as sorry for him as I often feel sorry for myself!
I really don't know how to find the first words and how could he do it, who speaks even more difficult? If only I could write to him, at least I knew he knew what I wanted to say, because words are so incredibly difficult!
Your Anne.
Friday, 17 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
The wind of relief blows through the Secret Annex. Kraler was acquitted by the big council. Elli has given her nose a tap and strictly forbidden him to bother her today. Everything all-right again, except that Margot and I get our parents a little tired. You shouldn't misunderstand me, I don't get along well with mom at the moment, you know, I love dad just as much and Margot loves mom and dad, but when you're as old as we are, you want to decide for yourself, you want to get rid of your parents' hands.
When I go upstairs, I am asked what I want to do, I am not allowed to have salt with dinner, at a quarter past eight mother invariably asks every night, if I should not undress yet, every book I read must be inspected. To be honest, that inspection is not strict at all and I can read almost everything, and yet, all those comments and comments plus all that questioning throughout the day, we both find difficult.
Another thing is especially not to their liking with me, I do not want to give kisses here and kisses there anymore, imaginary names I find offensive, in short, I would like to lose them for a while. Margot said last night: 'I find it really annoying that when you sigh twice with your hand under your head, they already ask if you have a headache or don't feel well!'
It is quite a blow for both of us that we now suddenly see how little of that confidential and harmonious is left of home. And that is in large part because we are so crooked. By this I mean that we are treated like children, as far as the outer things are concerned, and we are much older than girls our age in general, as far as inner things are concerned.
Even though I am only 14, I know very well what I want, I know who is right and wrong, I have my opinion, my opinion and my principles and even though it may sound crazy for a fry fish, I feel human, much more than child, I feel completely independent of any other soul.
I know that I can debate or discuss better than mother, I know that I am more objective, that I am not so exaggerated, neater and more handy and therefore - you can laugh about it - I feel like her superior in many things. When I love someone, I must first of all have admiration for them, admiration and respect. Everything would be good, as long as I have Peter, because for him I admire a lot of things. He's such a jne and handsome boy!
Your Anne.
Sunday, 19 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Yesterday was a very important day for me. I had decided to talk it out with Peter now. Just before we sat down, I whispered to him, "Are you doing shorthand tonight, Peter?" 'No', was his answer. 'I wanted to speak to you later!' He liked that. After washing the dishes, I stood at the window with his parents first, but it wasn't long before I went to Peter.' He was on the left side of the open window, I stood on the right and we talked. It was much easier to talk at the open window in the relatively dark than in so much light, and I believe Peter found that too.
We told each other so much, so much, that I can't repeat it all, but it was jn; the most beautiful evening I have ever had in the Secret Annex. In short, I will tell you the different topics anyway. First we talked about the quarrels, that I now have a very different attitude towards them than about the removal of us from our parents.
I told Peter about mother and father, about Margot and about myself.
At one point he asked, "Surely you always say goodnight to each other with a night kiss?"
"One, a lot, you don't, huh?"
'No, I have hardly ever given anyone a kiss'.
"Not even for your birthday?"
'Yes, then yes'.
We talked about trust, that neither of us gave our parents, that his parents wanted his trust, but that he didn't want it. That I cry out my sadness in bed and he starts cursing on the loft. That Margot and I only know each other so briefly and that we don't tell each other everything, because we are always together. About anything and everything, oh he was just like I knew he was!
Then we came to talk about 1942, how different we were then. We don't know each other in those people anymore. How we couldn't stand each other in the beginning. He found me busy and difficult and I soon found nothing to do with the whole boy. I didn't understand that he wasn't irresponsible, but now I'm happy. He also talked about how he isolated himself so much. I said that there is not much difference between my noise and his silence. That I also like peace and have nothing for me alone, except my diary. That he is happy, that my parents have children here and that I am happy that he is here. That I now understand him in his reclusiveness and his relationship with his parents and that I would be so happy to help him. "You always help me," he said. 'With what then?' I asked very surprised. 'With your cheerfulness!' That was the best thing he told me. It was wonderful, he must have come to love me, as a comrade and that is enough for now. I have no words for it, I am so grateful and happy and I have to apologize to you, Kitty, that my style is below par today.
I just wrote down what happened to me. Now I feel like Peter and I are sharing a secret. When he looks at me with those eyes, that smile and that wink, a light goes on inside me. I hope that it may continue to be this way, that we can spend many, many pleasant hours together!
Your grateful and happy Anne.
Monday, 20 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
This morning Peter asked if I would come again in the evening and said that I really did not bother him, that in his room, as well as there is room for one, there is also room for two. I said that I couldn't do it every night, that they didn't like it downstairs, but he thought I shouldn't be bothered by that. I then said that I would like to come on Saturday evening and asked him to warn me if the moon was there. "Then we go down," he replied, "look at the moon there."
In the meantime, a shadow has fallen on my happiness. I thought it for a long time, that Margot also liked Peter more than anything. I don't know to what extent she loves him, but I think it's bad. Every time I meet Peter now, I have to hurt her deliberately and the best thing is that she shows almost nothing.
I know I'd be desperate with jealousy, but Margot just says I shouldn't feel sorry for her.
'I think it's so bad that you're the third leg', I added. "I'm used to that," she replied somewhat bitterly.
I don't dare to tell Peter this yet, maybe later, we have to talk so much first.
Mother gave me a little stopper last night, which I really deserved. I must not allow myself to go too far in my indifference to her. So try again to be friendly in spite of everything and to leave my comments behind.
Pim isn't so cordial anymore either. He is now trying to treat me less childishly and is now far too cold. See what comes of that!
For now enough, I can't help but watch Peter and I'm packed! Your Anne.
Proof of Margot's goodness; this I received today the 20th of March 1944:
'Anne, when I said yesterday that I wasn't jealous of you, I was only 50% honest. The case is that I am not jealous of you or Peter. I think it's just a bit of a shame for myself, that I haven't found anyone yet and certainly won't find one for the time being, with whom I could talk about my thoughts and feelings. But that is why I would wholeheartedly grant it to both of you, if you could give each other some of your trust. You already miss enough here, which is so obvious to many others.
On the other hand, I am sure that I would never have come this far with Peter anyway, because I feel that I should be on a fairly intimate footing with the person with whom I would like to discuss a lot. I should feel that he understands me through and through, even without me saying much. But that is why it must be someone in whom I feel my superior spiritually and that is never the case with Peter. With you, I could imagine the above with Peter.
So you don't have to blame yourself at all, that I come up short and that you do something that belonged to me; nothing could be further from the truth. You and Peter will both only be able to win in dealing with each other'.
Answer from me:
'Dear Margot,
I found your note extremely sweet, but I am not yet completely comfortable with it and will not be.
There is no question of trust to the extent that you mean between Peter and me for the time being, but at an open and dark window you say more to each other than in the light sunshine. It is also better to retell your feelings in a uistrate than if you have to trumpet them like this. I believe that you have come to feel a kind of sisterly affection for Peter and would like to help him, at least as much as I do. Maybe you will be able to do that again, although that is not trust according to our intention. Because I think trust should come from both sides; I believe that is also the reason why it never got that far between father and me.
Let us separate it now and stop talking about it; if you want something else, please do it in writing, because that way I can say what I mean much better than verbally.
You don't know how I admire you and I just hope that I get something from fathers and your goodness again, because I don't see much difference between the two of you anymore.
Je Anne'.
Wednesday, 22 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
This is what I received last night from Margot:
'Dear Anne,
After your note yesterday, I have the unpleasant feeling that you feel remorse when you go to work or talk to Peter; there is absolutely no reason to do so. Inside me, someone is entitled to mutual trust and I would not be able to tolerate Peter in his place yet.
However, just as you wrote, I feel that Peter is a kind of brother, but ... a younger brother and that our feelings reach out to each other in a way that maybe later, maybe never, we can get into an affection like that of brother and sister; However, it is far from that.
So you don't have to feel sorry for me. Enjoy as much as you can the company you have now found.'
In the meantime, it is becoming more and more beautiful here. I believe, Kitty, that we might get a real, great love here in the Secret Annex. I really don't think about marrying him, I don't know how, when he's an adult, he'll agree. I also don't know if we'll love each other so much that we'd love to get married. That Peter also loves me, I am sure of that by now; how he loves me, I don't know.
Whether he only wants a good companion, or whether I attract him as a girl, or as a sister, I do not find out well.
When he said that I always help him in the quarrels between his parents, I was very happy and already a step on the way to believing in his friendship. Yesterday now I asked him what he would do if there were a dozen of those Anne's here and always came to him. His answer was, "If they were all like you, that wouldn't be so bad!" He is very hospitable to me and I do believe that he really likes to see me come. In the meantime, he learns French very diligently, even until a quarter past ten in the evening in bed. Oh, when I think of Saturday night, of our words, our mood, I am satisfied with myself for the first time; I mean, that I would say the same thing now and not everything else, which is usually the case otherwise.
He is so beautiful, both when he smiles and when he looks so quietly in front of him, he is so sweet and good. I think he was most taken aback by me when he noticed that I am not the superficial Anne of the world at all, but just as dreamy a specimen with as many difficulties as he is.
Your Anne.
Answer:
'Dear Margot,
I think the best thing is that we now wait and see what comes of it. It can no longer take so long that the decision falls between Peter and me, either just again or differently. I don't know how that should go, I don't think further than my nose is long. But one thing I do for sure, if Peter and I make friends, I will also tell him that you also love him very much and would be there for him, if necessary. You certainly won't want the latter, but I don't care now; I don't know what Peter thinks about you, but I'll ask him.
It is certainly not bad, on the contrary! Feel free to come to the attic or wherever we are, you really do not disturb us, because I believe we have both tacitly agreed that when we talk, we do it in the evening in the dark.
Take heart! I do it too, although it's not always easy; your time may come sooner than you think.
Je Anne'.
Thursday, 23 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Here everything rolls a bit again. Our receipt men have been released from prison, fortunately!
Miep has been back here since yesterday, Elli is better, although the cough persists, Koophuis will have to stay at home for a long time.
Yesterday a plane crashed here, the occupants jumped down with parachutes in time. The aircraft landed at a school where there were no children. A small fire and a few deaths have emerged from the case. The Germans shot terribly at the descending kites. The watching Amsterdammers were just about bursting with anger at such a cowardly act. We, that means the ladies, scared us a target, I think shooting is lousy.
Nowadays I often go upstairs in the evening and eat the fresh evening air in Peter's room. I like to sit on top of a chair next to him and look outside.
Van Daan and Dussel are very ouchy when I disappear into his room. 'Anne's zweite Heimat' is what it's called, or 'does it fit for young gentlemen to have young girls visiting late at night in the dark?' Peter has an amazing presence of mind at such supposedly witty remarks.
My mother is also not a little curious and would love to ask about the topics of our conversations, if she was not silently afraid of a negative answer. Peter says that the adults feel nothing but envy, because we are young and do not care much about their hatefulness. Sometimes he takes me off from downstairs, but despite all precautions he gets a firerod face and can hardly get out of his words. I am glad that I never get red, it certainly seems to me a highly unpleasant sensation.
Father always says I'm a nuf, that's not true, I'm just vain! I haven't heard from many people that they think I'm pretty in appearance. Except from a boy at school, who said I looked so nice when I laughed. Yesterday now I received a sincere compliment from Peter and for the sake of kindness I will pretty much reflect our conversation:
Peter said so many times, "Laugh!" I noticed that and I asked, "Why do I always have to laugh?"
'Because that's fun; you get dimples in your cheeks, why is that?' 'That's what I was born with. That's also in my chin. That's the only beauty thing I have.'
'Well, that's not true'.
'Yes, I know that I am not a beautiful girl, I never have been and never will be'.
'I don't think that at all, I think you're handsome'.
"That's not true."
"If I say that, you can take that from me!"
I said the same thing about him, of course.
I must hear a lot from all of them about the sudden friendship. We don't care much about all those parent chatter, their comments are so ouch. Would the various parents have forgotten their childhood? It seems so, at least they always take us seriously when we make a joke and laugh at us when we are serious.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
A very large chapter in our history of hiding on paper should actually occupy politics, but since this subject does not concern me personally that much, I have ignored it far too much. That is why today I am going to devote an entire letter to politics.
That there are many different views on this question is self-evident, that there is also a lot of talk about it in difficult times of war is even more logical, but ... that there is so much arguing about it is simply stupid.
Let them bet, laugh, scold, grumble, let them do everything, as long as they smother in their own fat, but don't let them argue, because that usually has less good consequences.
The people who come from outside bring a lot of untrue news; however, our radio has never lied until now. Henk, Miep, Koophuis, Elli and Kraler all show ups and downs in their political moods, Henk the least of them.
Here in the Secret Annex, the mood is always the same as far as politics is concerned. In the countless debates about invasion, aerial bombardments, speeches and so on and so forth, one also hears countless exclamations such as 'impossible', 'Um Gottes Want, if they only want to start now, what is that supposed to be!' 'It's going very well, fine, best!' Optimists and pessimists, not to mention the realists, give their opinion with tireless energy and as with everything, everyone thinks that he is only right. A certain lady is annoyed by the incomparable trust that her lord's husband places in the English, a certain gentleman attacks his lady for her teasing and disparaging remarks about his beloved nation.
They're never going to get bored. I invented something and the effect of it is amazing; it's like pricking someone with a pin and making them jump up. This is exactly how my tool works: start talking about politics; one question, one word, one sentence and immediately the whole family is in the middle of it!
As if the German Weermachtberichten and the English B.B.C. were not enough, a 'Luftlagemeldung' has been enabled for a while now. Magni ek in one word, but on the other hand also often disappointing. The English turn their air weapon into a continuous business - only comparable to the German lies, which are ditto -. So, the radio is on early in the morning and is heard every hour, until nine, ten or often eleven o'clock in the evening.
This is the cleanest proof that, although the adults have patience, they have hard-to-reach brains - with exceptions, of course, I do not want to offend anyone . After one, at most two broadcasts, we would have enough for the whole day! But those old geese, and n, I said!
Arbeiter-Programm, Oranje, Frank Philips or Her Majesty Wilhelmina, everything gets a turn and an equally willing ear. And if they're not eating or sleeping, they're on the radio talking about food, sleep and politics.
Phew, it becomes annoying and quite a tour to not become a boring berry. With the ouelui, the latter can no longer do such a harm!
To give a shining example, a speech by Winston Churchill, who is very dear to us all, is ideal.
Sunday evening, nine o'clock. The tea under the hat on the table, the guests come in. Sosel next to the radio on the left, sir in front of it, Peter next to it. Mother next to sir, mrs at the back and Pim at the table, Margot and me next to it. I notice that I don't write very clearly how they sit. The gentlemen puff, Peter's eyes fall from strenuous listening, mom in long dark négligé and mrs shivering because of the kites who do not care about reason and fly lustily to Essen, father slurping tea, Margot and I sisterly united by the sleeping Mouschi who has seized two different knees. Margot has curls in the hair; I am dressed in a far too small, too narrow and too short night costume.
It seems intimately cozy, peaceful, it is also so for this time; yet I await with horror the consequences of reason. After all, they can hardly wait for the lock, kicking with impatience to be able to discuss it. Kst, kst, kst, that's how they stimulate each other, until the discussion leads to arguments and disagreements.
Your Anne.

Dearest Kitty,
I could write a lot more about politics, but I have a lot of other things to report today. First of all, mother actually forbade me to go upstairs so often, because according to her Mrs. Van Daan is jealous. Secondly, Peter has invited Margot to come up: whether it is politeness or serious, I do not know. Thirdly, I started asking my father if he thought that I should be bothered a lot by that jealousy and he didn't think so. What now? Mother is angry, maybe jealous too. Father grants Peter and me those hours and thinks it is possible that we get along so well. Margot also loves Peter, but feels that you can't discuss with the three of you what you can do with the two of you.
Mother thinks Peter is in love with me, honestly I just wish it was true, then we are fine and can reach each other much easier. She goes on to say that he looks at me so much. Now it is true that we wink each other more than once in the room and that he looks at my cheek pits, I can't do anything about that! Is it?
I am in a very difficult position. Mother is against me and I against her, father closes his eyes to the silent battle between mother and me. Mother is sad, because she loves me a lot, I am not sad at all, because I feel that she does not understand me. And Peter ... I don't want to give up on Peter, he is so sweet, I admire him so much, it will be so beautiful between us, why do those 'ouwen' put their noses in again? Fortunately, I'm used to hiding my inner self and I'm perfectly unable to show how much I love him. Will he ever say anything? Will I ever feel his cheek, as I felt Petel's cheek in my dream? O Peter and Petel, you are the same! They don't understand us, would never understand that we are already satisfied, as long as we sit together and don't talk. They do not understand what drives us so close to each other. Oh, when would all those difficulties have been overcome, and yet it is good to overcome them, for then the end is all the more beautiful. If he lies with his head on his arms with his eyes closed, then he is still a child, if he plays with Mouschi, then he is loving, if he carries potatoes or other heavy things, then he is powerful, if he goes to look at the thieves or in the dark, then he is courageous and if he acts so inept and clumsy,  then he is sweet.
I find it much more pleasant when he explains something to me than when I have to teach him something: I would like him to have a predominance over me in almost everything.
How I care about those many mothers! Oh, if only he wanted to speak. Your Anne.
Wednesday, 29 March, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Last night Minister Bolkestein spoke for the Oranjezender about the fact that after the war a collection of diaries and letters from this war would be held. Of course, they all rushed straight to my diary. Imagine how interesting it would be if I published a novel by the Secret Annex. People would think of the title alone that it was a detective novel.
But now in earnest. It must already feel funny about ten years after the war, when we tell how we as Jews have lived, eaten and spoken here. Although I tell you a lot about us, you only know a little bit about our lives.
How much fear the ladies have when they bomb, for example Sunday, when 350 English machines have dropped half a million kilos of bombs on IJmuiden, how then the houses vibrate like a blade of grass in the wind, how many epidemics prevail here. You don't know anything about all these things and I would have to keep writing all day if I had to retell everything in the nesses. The people are queuing up for vegetables and all kinds of other things, the doctors can't get to the sick, because every now and then their vehicle is stolen, burglaries and thefts are plentiful, so much so that you start to wonder what animates the Dutch that they have suddenly become so steadfast. Small children of eight and eleven years old smash the windows of houses and steal what is loose and stuck. No one dares to leave their house for five minutes, because when you're gone, your stuff is gone. Every day there are advertisements in the newspaper with rewards for returning stolen typewriters, Persian rugs, electric clocks, fabrics etc. etc. Electric street clocks are disassembled, the phones in the cells are taken apart down to the last wire. The mood among the population can not be good: everyone is hungry, with the weekly ration you can not come out for two days, except with kof esurrogate. The invasion is a long time coming, the men have to go to Germany. The children get sick or are malnourished, everyone has bad clothes and bad shoes.
A sole clandestinely costs ƒ 7.50; in addition, most shoemakers do not take on customers or you have to wait four months for the shoes, which have often disappeared in the meantime.
One thing is good here, namely that the sabotage against the government is getting worse and worse, as the food gets worse and the measures against the people become stricter. The distribution service, the police, the civil servants, everything either participates to help the fellow citizens or to inform them and thereby have them put in prison. Fortunately, only a small percentage of Dutch citizens are on the wrong side.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
Imagine, it is still quite cold, but most people have been without coal for about a month, pleasant huh! The mood in general is again optimistic for the Russian front, because that's great! I don't write much about politics, but where they are now I have to tell you, they are right in front of the Government General and near Romania on the Proeth. They are close to Odessa. Here they wait every night for an extra communiqué from Stalin.
In Moscow they shoot so many salute shots that the city has to thump every day; whether they like to pretend that war is around again, or they don't know any other way to express their joy, I don't know!
Hungary has been occupied by German troops, there are still a million Jews there, who will now also enter.
The chatter about Peter and me is a bit calm. We are very good friends, together a lot and talk about all possible topics. It's so that I should never hold back as I would with other guys when we get into the precarious field.
My life here has gotten better, much better. God has not left me alone and will not leave me alone.
Your Anne.
Saturday, 1 April, 1944
Dear Kitty,
And yet everything is still so difficult, you surely know what I mean, huh? I long so much for a kiss, the kiss that has been delayed for so long. Would he still consider me a comrade all the time? Am I not more?
You know, and I know, that I am strong, that I can bear most of the burdens on my own. I've never been used to sharing my burdens with anyone, I've never clung to my mother, but now I'd love to put my head against his shoulder and just be calm.
I can't, can never forget Peter's cheek's dream, when everything, everything was so good! Wouldn't he also long for that? Would he just be too shy to confess his love? Why does he want me with him so often? Oh, why doesn't he speak?
Let me stop, let me be calm, I will keep myself strong and with some patience the other will come too, but ... and that's the bad thing, it looks so bad if I'm following him, I always have to go upstairs, not he goes to me.
But that is up to the chambers and he understands that objection. Oh yes, he will understand more.
Your Anne.
Monday, 3 April 1944
Dear Kitty,
Completely against my habit, I will write you extensively about the food, because it has become a very important and difficult factor not only in the Secret Annex, but also throughout the Netherlands, throughout Europe and beyond.
We have already experienced a lot of 'eating periods' in the 21 months that we are now here, what that means you will hear immediately. By 'eating periods' I mean periods in which one gets nothing to eat other than a certain dish or a certain vegetable. For a while we had nothing to eat but endive every day with sand, without sand, stew, loose and in the refractory dish, then it was spinach, then came cabbage, salsify, cucumbers, tomatoes, sauerkraut and so on and so forth.
It is not fun to eat sauerkraut every afternoon and every evening, for example, but you do a lot when you are hungry. Now, however, we have the best period, because we do not get any fresh vegetables at all. Our weekly menu of the afternoon consists of: kidney beans, pea soup, potatoes with flour balls, potato chalet, by the grace of God turnip greens or rotten carrots and then kidney beans again. We eat potatoes before every meal, starting at breakfast due to lack of bread. For soup we take brown or white beans, potatoes, julienne from packets, queen from packets, kidney beans from packets. Everything contains kidney beans, not least in the bread.
In the evening we always eat potatoes with artificial gravy and, fortunately, beetroot lettuce. I still have to talk about the flour balls, we make them from government flour with water and yeast. They are so sticky and chewy, it's like there are stones in your stomach, but a jn!
Our big attraction is a slice of liverwurst every week and the jam on dry bread. But we are still alive and often we even like our meager meal.
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 4 April, 1944
Dear Kitty,
For a long time I didn't know what I'm working for now; the end of the war is so incredibly far, so unreal, fairytale-like. If the war is not over in September, I will no longer go to school. Because I don't want to find out for two years. The days consisted of Peter, nothing but Peter, dreams and thoughts, until I became so incredibly lame on Saturday, no terrible. I just sat with Peter to hold back my tears, then laughed with Van Daan at the lemon punch, was cheerful and excited, but hardly alone I knew that I had to cry now. So in my nightgown I let myself slide on the floor and first prayed very intensely my long prayer, then I cried with the head on the arms, knees pulled up, on the bare floor, completely folded together. With a loud sob I came back into the room and bedded my tears, as they were not allowed to hear anything inside. Then I started to give myself courage, I said nothing but: 'I have to, I have to, I have to...' Completely stiff from the unusual position, I fell against the bed side and then fought on, until I got back into bed shortly before half past eleven. It was over!
And now it's all over. I have to work to not stay stupid, to get ahead, to become a journalist, because that's what I want! I know I can write, a few stories are good, my Secret Annex descriptions humorous, a lot from my diary speaks, but ... whether I really have talent, that remains to be seen.
Eva's dream was my best fairy tale and the crazy thing about it is that I really don't know where it comes from. Much of Cady's life is also good, but the whole thing is nothing. I myself am my sharpest and best assessor here. I know for myself what is good and what is not well written. No one who doesn't write knows what writing is like; in the past I always regretted that I could not draw at all, but now I am overjoyed that I can at least write. And if I don't have a talent for writing for newspapers or books, well, I can still write for myself.
I want to move forward, I cannot imagine, that I would have to live like mother, Mrs Van Daan and all those women, who do their work and who are later yellowed. I must have something besides husband and children, which I can dedicate myself to!
I want to live on even after my death! And that is why I am so grateful to God that he has already given me an opportunity at birth to develop and to write, so to express everything that is in me.
With writing I lose everything, my sadness disappears, my courage revives. But, and this is the big question, will I ever be able to write something big again, will I ever become a journalist and writer?
I hope so, oh I hope so, because in writing I can capture everything, my thoughts, my ideals and my fantasies.
I haven't worked on Cady's life for a long time, in my mind I know exactly how it will go on, but it doesn't go well. Maybe it never comes off, it ends up in the trash or stove ... That's a bad idea, but then I think again, 'with 14 years and so little experience you can't write a philoso e'.
So on and on, with new courage, it will work, because I want to write!
Your Anne.
Thursday, 6 April, 1944
Dear Kitty,
You have asked me what my hobbies and interests are and I want to answer you. However, I warn you, don't be alarmed, there are a lot of them.
In the first place: writing, but that doesn't really count as a hobby.
No two: family trees. From the French, German, Spanish, English, Austrian,
Russian, Norwegian and Dutch royal families I am looking for family trees in all newspapers, books and papers. With many I am already very far advanced, especially since I have been taking notes from all the biogra een or history books I read for a long time. I even write about many pieces of history.
My third hobby is history, for which father has already bought many books for me. I can hardly wait for the day when I can check everything in the Public Library.
Number four is mythology of Greece and Rome. I also have several books about this.
Further hobbies are lmstars and family photos. Love to read and to read books. Feel a lot for art history; especially writers, poets and painters. Musicians may come later. I have certain antipathy towards algebra, geometry and arithmetic.
I enjoy doing all other school subjects, but history above all!
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 11 April, 1944
Dear Kitty,
My head is right, I don't know what to start with.
Friday (Good Friday) we played stock market games in the afternoon, Saturday afternoon as well. These days all went very quickly and simply. Sunday afternoon Peter came to me at my invitation at half past five, at a quarter past five we went to the attic, where we stayed until six o'clock. From six o'clock to a quarter past seven a beautiful Mozart concert was given on the radio, especially theKleine Nachtmusik I enjoyed very much. I can hardly listen in the room, because with beautiful music everything in me moves.
Sunday evening Peter and I went together at eight o'clock to the attic and to sit softly we took some divan cushions, which could be found in our room, with us. We took a seat in one coffin. Box as well as pillows were very narrow, we sat all the way against each other and both leaned against other boxes. Mouschi kept us company, so we were not unseen.
Suddenly, at a quarter to nine, Mr. Van Daan and asked if we had a kisse from Mr. Dussel. Both of us jumped up and went down with kisses, cat and Van Daan.
From this pillow came a whole misery, because Dussel was angry that one of his pillows was there, which he used as a 'Night pillow'. He was afraid that there were fleas in it and brought everything in turmoil for that one pillow.
Peter and I then put two hard brushes in his bed as revenge. We did laugh at this interlude.
Our fun wouldn't last long. At half past ten Peter knocked softly at the door and asked father if he wanted to help upstairs with a difficult English sentence. 'That's not fluff', I said to Margot, 'the fabrication is thick on top of it'. My assumption was correct: they were just breaking into the warehouse. In a minimum of time father, Van Daan, Dussel and Peter were downstairs, Margot, mother, mrs and I waited.
Four women in fear have to talk, so do we, until we heard a blow downstairs. Then everything went silent, the clock struck a quarter to ten. The color of all our faces had disappeared; we were still quiet, although scared. Where would the gentlemen have gone? What was that battle? Would they possibly fight with the burglars? Ten o'clock, steps on the stairs: father pale and nervous, came in, followed by Mr. Van Daan. 'Lights out, gently upwards, we expect police in the house!'.
There was no time for fear, the lights went out, I quickly grabbed a jacket and we were upstairs. 'What happened, tell me soon!' There was no one to tell, the gentlemen were back downstairs. Only ten past ten did all four of them come upstairs, two kept watch at Peter's open window, the door to the landing was closed, the turntable closed. Around the night light we hung a sweater, then they told:
Peter heard two loud bangs on the landing, walked down and saw that a large shelf was missing on the left side of the warehouse door. He held upstairs, warned the resilient part of the family, and the four of them went down. The burglars were breaking further when they entered the warehouse. Without thinking, Van Daan shouted: 'Police!'
Hasty steps outside, the burglars had fled. To prevent the police from noticing the hole, the plank was put back in front of it, but due to a small kick from outside, it flew to the ground again. The gentlemen were perplexed by so much brutality, Van Daan as well as Peter felt murderous tendencies coming up; with the axe Van Daan hit the ground hard, everything was quiet again. Again they wanted to put the board in front of the hole. Disturbance! - A couple outside, with the shrill glow of a flashlight, shone the entire warehouse through the opening. "Rusty," muttered one of the gentlemen and ... now their role changed from police to burglars. All four of them sneaked upstairs, Peter quickly opened the doors and windows of the kitchen and private office, threw the phone on the floor and finally all four ended up behind the shelter wall.
End of the first part.
In all likelihood, the couple would have warned the police with the flashlight; it was Sunday evening, the evening of Easter Sunday, Easter Monday no one in the office, so no one could move before Tuesday morning. Imagine spending two nights and a day in this fear! We didn't imagine anything, just sat in the pitch dark, because mrs. had already turned off the lamp completely out of fear, the voices were ringing, with every crackle sounded the best. sst.'.
It was half past eleven, eleven o'clock, no sound, father and Van Daan came to us in turn. Then a quarter past eleven, noise down. With us, the breathing of the whole family was audible, incidentally we did not move. Steps in the house, private office, kitchen, then ... our staircase. No one was breathing audibly now, eight hearts were pounding, steps on our stairs, then rattling at the turntable. This moment is indescribable. "Now we are lost!" I said, and I saw all of us taken away by the Gestapo that same night. Rattling at the turntable twice, then something fell, the steps removed, so far we were saved. A shiver ran through all of us, from the indeterminate side I heard flapping teeth, no one said a word.
Nothing was left in the house, but there was light on our landing, just in front of the cupboard. Could that be because the closet was mysterious? Had the police perhaps forgotten the light? Did anyone else come to take it off? The tongues came loose, no one was in the house anymore, maybe a guard at the door.
Three things we did now, making assumptions, shivering with fear and going to the W.C. must. The buckets were in the attic, only Peter's tin trash could serve. Van Daan made a start, then father came, mother was too ashamed. Father brought the bin to the room, where Margot, mrs and I liked to use it, finally mother also decided. There was always a demand for some paper, fortunately I had it in my pocket.
The container smelled, everything was ravaging and we were tired, it was twelve o'clock. 'Lie down on the floor and sleep'. Margot and I each got a pillow plus blanket, Margot was a piece away from the pantry, me between the legs of the table. On the floor it didn't smell so bad, but mrs. gently fetched some bleaching powder, a drying cloth served as a second protective agent over the pot.
Talk, you rant, fear, stench, winds and always someone on the pot; sleep with that! At half past three, however, I became too tired and until half past four I heard nothing. I woke up when the lady was lying with her head on my foot.
"Please give me something to do!" I asked. I got, but don't ask what, wool pants over my pyjamas, a red sweater and a black skirt, white under stockings and broken knee socks. Mrs. then took a seat on the chair again and sir came to lie on my feet. From half past four I started thinking, I was still shaking, so Van Daan could not sleep. I was preparing for the police to come back, then we have to say that we are people in hiding; either they are good Dutch people, then we are saved, or they are N.S.B.-ers, then we have to bribe them!
"Get rid of the radio," she sighed. "Yes, in the stove," replied sir, "if they find us, they can also find the radio!"
'Then they also find Anne's diary', Vader added. "Burn that," suggested the most frightened of us all.
This and when the police rattled the closet door were my scariest moments. 'Not my diary, my diary only with me!' But father didn't answer anymore, fortunately.
It has no purpose in quoting all the conversations I remember; there was so much talk. I comforted the lady in her fear. We talked about fleeing and hearing from the Gestapo, about calling up and being brave.
'Now we have to behave like soldiers, madam, if we go, now good, then for Queen and Fatherland, for freedom, truth and justice, as radio Oranje always says. The only thing that is very bad is that we drag them all into the accident.'
Mr. Van Daan exchanged with his wife after an hour, father came to me. The gentlemen smoked on in one piece, occasionally a deep sigh, then another pee and then everything started again.
Four hours, five hours, half past six. Now I sat down with Peter in the window room listening, so close together that we felt the vibrations of each other's bodies, we spoke a word every now and then and listened keenly. Next to us in the room they darkened. At seven o'clock they wanted to call Koophuis and have someone come here. Now they wrote down what they wanted to tell Koophuis on the phone. The risk that the guard at the door or in the warehouse heard that call was great, but the danger that the police would return was even greater.
The points were:
Burglarized: police have been in the house up to the revolving door, no further. Burglars apparently disturbed, forced warehouse and fled through the garden.
Main entrance locked, Kraler must have left through the second door. The typewriters and calculator are safe in the black box at private office. Henk trying to warn and get a key from Elli, then go to the office to look, pretext: feeding cat.
Everything went according to plan. Koophuis was called, the typewriters, which were upstairs with us, put in the box. Then we sat back at the table and waited for Henk or the police.
Peter had fallen asleep, Van Daan and I were lying on the floor, when we heard hard steps downstairs. Softly I stood up: 'That's Henk'.
'No, no, that's the police', I heard from others.
There was a knock at our door, Miep oot. Mrs. Van Daan then became too powerful, corpse white and limp she hung in her chair and if the tension had lasted one minute, she would have fallen ouch.
When Henk and Miep entered, our room provided a wonderful image, only the table was worth a photo. A Cinema & Theater, full of jam and a remedy for diarrhoea, lay open on a dance girl's page, two jam jars, a half and a quarter sandwich, mirror, comb, matches, ashes, cigarettes, tobacco, ashtray, books, underpants, flashlight, toilet paper, etc. etc. were mixed together in colourful mixture.
Henk and Miep were of course greeted with cheers and tears. Henk closed the hole with wood and soon left to inform the police of the burglary. Miep had also found a note under the warehouse door from the night watchman Slagter, who found the hole open and had warned the police, who he would also look for.
So we had half an hour to recover. Never before have I seen so much change in half an hour. Margot and I laid out the beds downstairs, went to the W.C., brushed our teeth, washed ourselves and made up our hair. Then I cleaned up the room a bit and went back upstairs. The table was already cleared there, we tapped water, made kof e and tea, boiled milk and covered for the kof e-hour, father and Peter emptied the po's and cleaned them with warm water and bleaching powder.
At eleven o'clock we sat around the table with Henk, who was back, and it gradually became cozy again. Henk's story was as follows:
'At Slagter the woman told us, because the gentleman was asleep, that her husband had discovered the hole near us on his way around the canals and had walked through the plot with an agent who had been brought in. He would come to Kraler on Tuesday and then tell him more. At the police station they did not know anything about the burglary, but immediately noted it to also come and see Tuesday. On the way back Henk happened to walk around the corner at our potato supplier and told us that there had been a break-in. "I know that," said this person, "I came with my wife past your plot last night and saw a hole in the door. My wife wanted to walk through, but I looked with the lantern; then the thieves immediately ran away. To be sure, I did not call the police, because I did not want to do that with you, I do not know anything, but I suspect a lot.'
Henk thanked and went. That man certainly suspects that we are here, because he always brings the potatoes at noon. Nice guy!
After Henk had left and we had washed off, it was one hour. All eight of us went to sleep. At a quarter to three I woke up and saw that Mr Dussel had already disappeared. Quite by chance I came across Peter in the bathroom with my sleepy face, who just came from upstairs. We met downstairs.
I recovered and went downstairs. "Do you still dare to go to the attic?" he asked. I agreed, got my bed pillow and we went to the attic. The weather was beautiful and soon the sirens were blaring; we stayed where we were. Peter put his arm around my shoulder, I put my arm around his shoulder and so we, the arms around each other, quietly waited for Margot to come and get us at four o'clock before the kof e.
We ate our bread, drank lemonade and made jokes, that went again, everything else just ran. I thanked Peter in the evening, because he was the bravest of all.
None of us have ever been in such danger as we were that night. God has protected us very much; think of it, the police at our shelter, the light in front of it and we still go unnoticed.
If the invasion comes with bombs, everyone can stand up for themselves, but here the fear was also for our innocent and good protectors. "We are saved, save us!" That's all we can say.
This history has brought a lot of changes. In the future, Mr Dussel will no longer be downstairs in Kraler's office in the evening, but in the bathroom. Peter goes to check the house at half past nine and half past ten, Peter's window is no longer allowed to open at night. It is not allowed to continue on the W.C. after half past ten. Tonight a carpenter will come to reinforce the warehouse doors.
There are now debates before and after in the Secret Annex. Kraler has blamed us for our carelessness. Henk also said that we should never go down in such a case. We have been strongly reminded that we are people in hiding, that we are chained Jews, chained to a place, without rights but with a thousand duties. We Jews must not assert our feelings, must be courageous and strong, must take on all inconveniences and not grumble, must do what is in our power and trust in God. One day this terrible war will be a open, one day we will be people again and not just Jews.
Who imposed this on us? Who has made us Jews an exception among all nations? Who has made us suffer so much so far? It was God who made us this way, but it will also be God who lifts us up. If we bear all this suffering and still jews remain, then once the Jews will become doomed to examples. Who knows, maybe our faith may agree that the world and therefore all peoples learn the good and for that, for that alone we must also suffer. We can never become only Dutch, only English, or representatives of any country, we will always remain Jews, but we also want to remain so.
Be brave! Let us remain aware of our task and not grumble, there will be an outcome, God has never abandoned our people. Through all the centuries Jews have continued to live, through all the centuries Jews had to suffer, but through all the centuries they have also become strong; the weak fall, but the strong will remain and never suffer!
That night I actually knew I had to die, I was waiting for the police, I was willing, willing like the soldiers on the battlefield. I wanted to sacrifice myself for the fatherland, but now that I am saved again, now my first wish after the war is, make me Dutch!
I love the Dutch, I love our country, I love the language, and I want to work here. And although I should write to the Queen herself, I will not give way until my goal is achieved.
I am becoming more and more independent of my parents, as young as I am I have more courage in life, more right and unscathed sense of justice than mother. I know what I want, I have a goal, an opinion, I have a faith and a love. Let me be myself, then I will be satisfied. I know I am a woman, a woman with inner strength and a lot of courage.
If God makes me live, I will achieve more than mother ever did, I will not remain insignificant, I will work in the world and for people!
And now I know that courage and joy are needed first. Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
The mood here is still very tense. Pim is at boiling point, mrs. lies in bed with a cold and honks, sir without saf ons is pale, Dussel, who sacrificed much of his convenience, has comments etc. etc.
By the way, it's true, we're not bopping at the moment. The W.C. is leaking and the tap is turned, thanks to the many relationships, one as well as the other can be restored quickly.
Sometimes I'm sentimental, I know that, but ... there is sometimes also room for sentimentality here. When Peter and I sit somewhere between a lot of junk and dust on a hard wooden box, the arms around each other's shoulder close together, he with a curl of mine in his hand, as outside the birds are so trembling, when you see the trees turning green, when the sun lures out, when the sky is so blue,  oh then, then I want so much!
Nothing but dissatisfied and grumbling faces can be seen here, nothing but sighing and suppressed complaining, it seems as if we have suddenly gotten it terribly bad. Really, everything is just as bad as you make it yourself. Here in the Secret Annex there is no one who sets a good example, here everyone has to see how he can control his moods. 'If only it were over', you hear every day.
My work, my hope, my love, my courage, all of that keeps me upright and makes me good.
I definitely believe, Kit, that I'm a bit ticked today and I don't know why. Everything is mixed up here, no connection can be detected and I sometimes seriously doubt whether someone will interest my actions later on.
'The revelations of an ugly, young duckling', then becomes the title of all the nonsense. Mr Bolkestein or Gerbrandy will not benefit much from my diaries.
Your Anne.
Sunday morning, a little before 11 o'clock. 16th April 1944
Dearest Kitty,
Remember yesterday, because he is very important in my life. Isn't it important for every girl when she gets her first kiss? Well, for me, it's just as important. Bram's kiss on my right cheek doesn't count, nor does Mr Walker's on my right hand count.
How I got that kiss so suddenly, well, I'll tell you.
Last night at eight o'clock I was sitting with Peter on his divan, soon he put an arm around me. 'Let's arrange a little', I said, 'then I can't bump my head to the box'. He arranged, almost all the way to the corner, I put my arm under his on his back and he almost subdued me, because his arm hung around my shoulder.
Now we have been sitting like this more, but never as close to each other as last night. He pressed me stiffly against him, my left breast was on his, my heart was already beating faster, but we weren't done yet. He didn't rest until my head was on his shoulder and his back on top of it. When I sat up again after about five minutes, he quickly took my head in his hands and put it back against him. Oh, it was so delicious, I couldn't speak much, the pleasure was too great. He awkwardly stroked my cheek and arm a little awkwardly, fidgeting with my curls and our heads were all the way together most of the time. I can't tell you the feeling that flowed through me, Kitty, I was too happy and so was he, I believe.
At half past nine we got up, Peter put on his gym shoes to walk softer on the round through the house and I stood by. How it came so suddenly, I don't know, but before we went down, he gave me a kiss, between my hair, half on my left cheek, half on my ear. I ran down, without looking back and am very longing for today.
Your Anne.
Monday, 17 April 1944
Dear Kitty,
Do you believe that father and mother would approve, that I am sitting on a divan kissing a boy, a boy of 171⁄2 and a girl of almost 15? I actually don't believe so, but I have to rely on myself in this. It is so quiet and safe to lie in his arms and dream, it is so exciting to feel his cheek against mine, it is so wonderful to know that someone is waiting for me. But, there is indeed a but, because will Peter want to leave it at that? I haven't forgotten his promise yet, but ... he's a boy!
I know myself that I am very early; not even 15 and already so independent, that is a bit incomprehensible to other people. I'm pretty sure Margot would never give a boy a kiss without getting engaged or getting married, but neither Peter nor I have such plans. Mother certainly did not touch a man before father either. What would my friends say if they knew I was in Peter's arms with my heart on his chest, with my head on his shoulder, with his head against mine!
O Anne, how disgraceful; but really, I don't think it's disgraceful, we're sitting here shut off, cut off from the world, in fear and worry in particular lately, why should we, who love each other, stay apart from each other? Why should we wait until we are of the appropriate age? Why should we ask a lot?
I took it upon myself to babysit, he would never want to hurt or hurt me, so why not do what my heart tells me and make us both happy? Still, I do believe, Kitty, that you notice a little bit of my doubt, I think it's my honesty, which rebels against sneakiness. Do you think it is my duty to tell father what I do? Do you think that our secret should be heard by a third party? Much of the jne would go off, but would my insides become calm as a result? I will talk to 'him' about it.
Oh yes, I want to talk to him about so much, because only to caress each other, I see no point in that. To tell our thoughts to each other, that involves a lot of trust, we will certainly both become stronger in the awareness of this trust!
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 18 April, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Here everything is good. Father just said that he certainly expects that before 20 May there will be very large-scale operations, both in Russia and Italy as well as in the West; I can imagine a liberation from our condition less and less.
Yesterday Peter and I finally got to our conversation, which had been postponed for at least ten days. I explained to him everything about the girls and did not hesitate to discuss the most intimate things. The evening ended with a mutual kiss, pretty much next to my mouth, it's really a feeling.
Maybe I'll take my beautiful-sentences-book upstairs to finally go a little deeper into things. I find no satisfaction in lying in each other's arms day after day and would love to imagine the same thing from him.
We have a beautiful spring after our bad winter; April is indeed beautiful, not too hot and not too cold with the occasional rain shower. Our chestnut is already quite green and here and there you can even see small candles.
Elli spoiled us Saturday with four bunches of flowers, three bunches of daffodils and a bunch of blue grapes, the latter was for me.
I have to do Algebra, Kitty, goodbye. Your Anne.
Wednesday, 19 April, 1944
Dear Darling,
What could be more beautiful in the world than looking into nature in front of an open window, hearing the birds utter, feeling the sun on your cheeks and having a sweet boy in your arms? It is so quiet and safe to feel his arm around me, to know him close and yet to remain silent; it can't be bad, because this rest is good. Oh, never to be disturbed again, not even by Mouschi.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 27 April, 1944
Dear Kitty,
This morning she was in a bad mood; nothing but complaining! First about the cold, that she does not get licorice, that many nose blows are not to last. Then, that the sun doesn't shine, that the invasion doesn't come, that we can't see out the window, and so on and so forth. We laughed terribly at her and it wasn't so bad if she laughed along.
At the moment I read: Emperor Charles V, written by a professor of the University of Göttingen; this man has been working on this book for 40 years. In five days I read 50 pages, that's all it takes. The book contains 598 pages, now you can calculate how long I will do about this and then the second part! But... very interesting!
What a schoolgirl doesn't hear about in one day, take me now. First I translated from Dutch into English a piece of Nelson's last battle. Then I went through the continuation of the Norwegian War (1700-1721), from Peter the Great, Charles XII, Augustus the Strong, Stanislaus Lescinsky, Mazeppa, from Görz, Brandenburg, Vorpommern, Rear Pomerania and Denmark plus the usual years.
Then I ended up in Brazil, reading of the Bahia tobacco, the abundant kof e, the one and a half million inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro, of Pernambuco and Sao-Paulo, not to mention the Amazon River. From negroes, mulattoes, mestizos, whites, more than 50% analphabeten and malaria. Since there was still some time left, I quickly went through a family tree. Jan de Oude, Willem Lodewijk, Ernst Casimir I, Hendrik Casimir I tot de kleine Margriet Franciska (born 1943 in Ottawa).
Twelve hours: In the attic I continued my program with church history ... Pf! up to one hour.
After two hours the poor child (hm, hm., again working, narrow-nosed broad-necked monkeys) was next. Kitty, tell me how many toes a hippopotamus has!!
Then follows the Bible, Noah's Ark, Shem, Ham and Japheth. Then Charles V. With Peter: 'The Colonel' in English by Thackeray. Hear French words and then compare the Missisippi with the Missouri.
I still have a cold and have infected both Margot and father and mother. As long as Peter doesn't get it, he had to have a kiss and called me his 'Eldorado'. Can't even, crazy boy! But he is sweet!
Enough for today, adieu! Your Anne.
Friday, 28 April, 1944
Dear Kitty,
I have never forgotten my dream of Peter Wessel (see early January). I feel when I think about it, today his cheek against mine with that wonderful feeling, which makes everything right.
With Peter here I had that feeling sometimes, but never to such a great extent, until ... we sat together last night, as usual on the divan, in each other's arms. Then the ordinary Anne suddenly slipped away and the second Anne came in its place, the second Anne, who is not overconfident and funny, but who only wants to love and be soft.
I sat against him and felt the emotion rise in me, the tears jumped in my eyes, the left fell on his overalls, the right dripped past my nose through the air, also on his overalls. Would he have noticed? No movement betrayed it. Would he feel the same way I do? He also hardly spoke a word. Would he know that he has two Anne's in front of him? These are all unanswered questions.
At half past nine I got up, walked to the window, there we always say goodbye. I was still shaking, I was still Anne no two, he came to me, I put my arms around his neck and pressed a kiss on his left cheek, just wanted to go to the right, when my mouth met his and we pressed on it. Dizzying, we pressed ourselves against each other, again and again, never to stop, oh!
Peter is in need of tenderness, he has discovered a girl for the first time in his life, has seen for the first time, that the most teasing girls also have an inner self and a heart and change, as soon as they are alone with you. He has given his friendship and himself for the first time in his life, he has never had a boyfriend or girlfriend before. Now we have found each other: I did not know him either, never had a trusted one and this is where it ended ...
Again that question that doesn't let me go: 'Is it okay? Is it good that I give in so quickly that I am so intense, as intense and longing as Peter himself? Can I, a girl, let me go like that?' There is only one answer to this: "I desire so ... for so long, I am so lonely and have now found comfort!"
In the morning we are used to it, in the afternoon also quite a bit, except occasionally, but in the evening the desire of the whole day, the happiness and bliss of all the previous times comes up again and we only think of each other. Every night, after the last kiss, I would like to run away, no longer look him in the eye, away, away, in the dark and alone!
And what do I get when I have gone down the 14 steps? The full light, here and laughter there, I have to act and I am not allowed to show anything. My heart is still too week to immediately push away such a shock as last night. The soft Anne does not come enough and therefore does not let herself be chased out the door immediately. Peter touched me, deeper than I had ever touched in my life, except in my dream! Peter has tackled me, turned my insides outwards, isn't it self-evident for every person that he must then have rest to restore his insides?
Oh Peter, what did you do to me? What do you want from me? Where should this go?
Oh, now I understand Elli, now, as I go through this, now I understand her doubt; if I was older and he wanted to marry me, what would I answer? Anne, be honest! You couldn't marry him, but letting go is also so hard. Peter still has too little character, too little willpower, too little courage and strength. He is still a child, no older than me inside; he just wants to find peace and happiness.
Am I really only 14? Am I really still a stupid schoolgirl? Am I really that inexperienced in everything? I have more experience than the others, I have experienced something that hardly anyone at my age knows. I'm afraid of myself, I'm afraid, that in my desire I'll give me away too soon, how can that go well with other guys later on? Oh, it is so difficult, there is always the heart and the mind again, everything has to speak in time, but am I sure that I have chosen the time well?
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 2 May 1944
Dear Kitty,
Saturday night I asked Peter if he thinks I should tell dad something about us, he thought after a bit back and forth he did. I was happy, it testifies to feeling pure with him. As soon as I came downstairs, I went with my father to fetch water, on the stairs I already said: 'Father, you certainly understand that when Peter and I are together, we are not a meter apart, do you mind?' Father didn't answer immediately, then he said: 'No, I don't mind, but Anne, here in that limited space you have to be careful'. He said something else in that spirit, then we went upstairs. On Sunday morning he called me to him and said: 'Anne, I've thought about it again' - I was already scared -. It's actually not that good here in the Secret Annex, I thought you were comrades. Is Peter in love?'
"No matter," I replied.
"Yes, you know I understand you, but you have to be cautious, don't go upstairs as often anymore, don't wake him up more than necessary. The man is always the active one in such things, the woman can stop. It's outside when you're free something completely different, you see other boys and girls, you can go away, do sports and all sorts of things, but here, if you sit here too much together and you want to leave, you can't, you see each other every hour, always actually. Be careful, Anne, and don't take it too seriously!"
"I don't, father, but Peter is decent, he's a sweet boy!"
'Yes, but he does not have a strong character, he can be influenced lightly to the good side, but also slightly to the bad side, I hope for him that he remains good, because in his nature he is good!'
We talked a bit more and agreed that father would also talk to him.
Sunday afternoon in the attic he asked: 'And have you spoken to your father, Anne?'
"Yes," I replied, "I'll tell you. Father doesn't mind, but he says that here, where we are so close together, there may be slight collisions.'
"We agreed that we would not argue; I intend to stick to that!'
"Me too, Peter, but father didn't think so of us, he thought we were comrades, do you think that's not possible now?"
"Me and you?"
'Me too. I also told father that I trust you. I trust in you, Peter, as completely as I do in father and I believe you are worthy of it, isn't it?"
'I hope so'. (He was very shy and reddish.) "I believe in you, Peter," I continued, "I believe that you have a good character and that you will move forward in the world."
We talked about other things afterwards, later I said: 'If we come out of this, I know that you will not care about me anymore!'
He caught fire: 'That's not true, Anne, oh no, you can't think that of me!' Then I was called.
Father talked to him, he told me today. "Your father thought that camaraderie might end in falling in love," he said. But I replied that we will keep each other in check.
Father now wants me to go upstairs less in the evening, but I don't want that. Not only that I like to be with Peter, I have said that I trust him. I also trust him and I want to prove that trust to him and I can never do that if I stay downstairs out of distrust.
No, I'm going!
Wednesday, 3 May, 1944
Dear Kitty,
First the news of the week. Politics has holidays; there is nothing, but nothing to share. Gradually I have also come to believe that the invasion is coming, they cannot let the Russians fix everything on their own; besides, they are not doing anything at the moment either.
Did I tell you that our Mof is gone? Since last week Thursday disappeared without a trace. She will certainly have been in cat heaven for a long time, while some animal lover makes her a nice bolt. Maybe a girl gets a hat off her skin. Peter is very saddened by this fact.
Since Saturday we have lunch at half past 12 in the afternoon, so in the morning we have to keep it up with a cup of porridge; this serves to save a meal. Vegetables are still very hard to get: we had rotten stew lettuce this afternoon. Ordinary lettuce, spinach and stew lettuce, otherwise there is no. In addition, rotten potatoes, so a delicious combination!
As you can certainly imagine, it is often said here in despair: 'For what, oh what is the war for now? Why can't people live peacefully with each other? Why does everything have to be destroyed?".
This question is understandable, but so far no one has found a conclusive answer. Yes, why are they building bigger and bigger planes in England, constructing ever heavier bombs and also unit houses for reconstruction? Why are millions spent every day for the war and not a penny is available for medicine, for the artists, for the poor people?
Why do people have to starve, when in other parts of the world the abundant food is rotting away? Oh, why are people so crazy?
I never believe that the war is the fault only of the great men, of the rulers and capitalists. Oh no, the little man likes to do it just as well, otherwise the peoples would have rebelled against it a long time ago! There is in men an urge to destroy, to beat to death, to kill and to rage, and as long as all mankind, without exception, has not undergone a great metamorphosis, war will rage, everything that has been built up, cultivated and grown will be violated and destroyed again, after which humanity must start again.
I have often been depressed, but never desperate, I consider this hiding as a dangerous adventure, which is romantic and interesting. I consider every hardship as an amusement in my diary. I have decided that I will live a different life than other girls and later a different life than ordinary housewives. This is the good start of the interesting and therefore, therefore, only in the most dangerous moments I have to laugh at the humorousness of the situation.
I'm young and still have a lot of locked-in traits, I'm young and strong and I'm experiencing this great adventure, I'm still in the middle of it and can't complain all day. I got a lot, a happy nature, a lot of cheerfulness and strength. Every day I feel how my inner self grows, how liberation is approaching, how beautiful nature is, how good the people around me are, how interesting this adventure is! So why should I be desperate?
Your Anne.
Friday, 5 May 1944
Dear Kitty,
Father is dissatisfied with me; he thought that after our conversation on Sunday, I would not automatically go upstairs every night. He doesn't want that 'Knutscherei'. I couldn't hear that word, it was enough to talk about it, why does he have to make me so bad now? I will speak to him today. Margot has given me good advice, here's what I want to say:
"I believe, father, that you expect an explanation from me, I will give it to you. You are disappointed in me, you expected more restraint from me, you want to be sure that I am just like a 14-year-old should be. You're wrong about that!
Since we have been here, from July 1942 until a few weeks ago, I really did not have it easy. If you knew what I didn't cry in the evening, how unhappy I was, how lonely I felt, you might understand that I want to go up!
I have not done it overnight, that I have come so far that I can live completely without a mother and without the support of anyone; it has taken me a lot, a lot of struggle and tears to become as independent as I am now. You can laugh and not believe me, I don't care, I know I'm a human being alone and I don't feel responsible to you for a penny. I only told you this because I thought you thought you thought I was too sneaky otherwise, but for my actions I have only to answer to myself.
When I had difficulties, you and you too closed your eyes and closed your ears, you did not help me, on the contrary, nothing but warnings I received, that I should not be so noisy. I was noisy, just so as not to be sad all the time, I was overconfident not to hear that voice inside all the time. I've been playing comedy for a year and a half, day in and day out, I haven't complained, I haven't fallen out of my role, none of that, and now, now I've finished. I have overcome! I am independent in body and mind, I no longer need a mother, I have become strong through all that struggle.
And now, now that I am on top of it, now that I know that I have fought, now I also want to continue my way myself, the way that I think is good. You can't and shouldn't consider me 14, I've gotten older because of all the trouble; I will not regret my actions, I will act as I think I can.
You can't gently keep me away from above, either you forbid me everything, or you trust me through thick and thin, so leave me alone!"
Your Anne.
Saturday, 6 May 1944.
Dear Kitty,
Yesterday before dinner I put a letter in my father's pocket, in which I wrote that, which I explained to you yesterday. After reading, according to Margot, he was upset all evening. (I was at the top of the dishes.) Poor Pim, I could know what the result of this epistle would be. He's so sensitive! I immediately told Peter not to ask or say anything more. Pim didn't say anything more about the case to me, would it still come?
Here everything goes pretty much again. What they tell us about the prices and people outside is hard to believe; half a pound of tea costs ƒ 350, a pound of kof e ƒ 80. -, butter ƒ 35. - per pound, one egg ƒ 1.45, for Bulgarian tobacco becomes ƒ 14. - paid per us! Everyone acts black, every errand boy offers something. Our baker's boy has delivered stop side, ƒ 0.90 a thin string, the milkman comes to clandestine food cards, a funeral home delivers cheese. Burglary, murder and theft take place every day, police officers and night watchmen participate just as hard as professional thieves, ied reen wants to have something in his stomach and since salary increases are forbidden, people have to swindle. The children's police continue to carry out investigative work, girls aged 15, 16, 17 and older are missing every day.
Your Anne.
Sunday morning, 7 May 1944
Dear Kitty,
Father and I had a long conversation yesterday afternoon; I cried terribly and he joined in. You know what he said to me, Kitty?
'I've received many letters in my life, but this is the ugliest! You
Anne, who has experienced so much love from your parents, who have parents, who are always there for you, who have always defended you no matter what, you speak of feeling no responsibility? You feel aggrieved and left alone, no Anne, that was a great injustice you did to us!
Maybe you didn't mean it that way, but it was written down like that, no Anne, we didn't deserve such a reproach!'
Oh, I have failed terribly, this is the worst act I have done in my life. I wanted nothing but bragging about my crying and my tears, nothing but pretending to be big to make him respect me. Certainly, I have had a lot of grief, but to accuse pim, he who has done everything for me and still does everything for me, no, that was more than mean.
It is very good that I was once brought down from my unattainable height, that my pride was once a bit cracked, because I was again much too pleased with myself. What Miss Anne does is not always good! Someone who causes such grief to another person, whom he says he loves, and still does so intentionally, is low, very low!
And most of all, I am ashamed of the way father has forgiven me; he will throw the letter in the stove and is now so sweet to me as if he has done something wrong. No, Anne, you still have a lot to learn, just start again, instead of looking down on others and blaming others!
I've had a lot of grief, but doesn't everyone at my age have that? I played a lot of comedy, but I wasn't even aware of it yet, I felt lonely, but I was almost never desperate! I should be deeply ashamed and I am deeply ashamed.
Done things do not take a turn, but one can prevent further. I want to start all over again and it can't be difficult, since I have Peter now. With him as support I can do it!
I'm not alone anymore, he loves me, I love him, I have my books, my writing book and my diary, I'm not so ugly, not so very stupid, have a cheerful nature and want to get a good character!
Yes Anne, you felt very well that your letter was too harsh and untrue, but you were still proud of it! Let me take father back as an example, and I will improve.
Your Anne.
Monday, 8 May 1944
Dear Kitty,
Have I ever told you anything about our family?
I do not think so, so I shall begin in a moment. My father had very wealthy parents. His father had worked his way up and his mother was of distinguished and wealthy family. For example, father in his youth had a really rich-son life, every week parties, balls, parties, beautiful girls, dinners, many rooms etc. etc.
All that money was lost after grandpa's death due to the world war and in atie. Father was raised fine and had to laugh terribly yesterday, because it was the first time in his 55 years of life that he scraped out the frying pan at the table.
Mother is also of rich parents and often we listen with open mouths to stories of engagements with 250 people, private balls and dinners. Now we can no longer be called rich under any circumstances, but all my hopes are pinned on after the war.
I assure you that I am not at all fond of such a narrow-minded life as mother and Margot. I would like to go to Paris for a year and london for a year to learn the language and study art history. Compare that to Margot, who wants to become a maternity nurse in Palestine! I still imagine a lot of beautiful dresses and interesting people. I want to see and experience something in the world, I have already told you more. And a little money can't hurt.
Miep told this morning of an engagement where she was going. Both the bride and the groom are from rich parents and it was therefore also special. Miep made us equally tasty with the food they received: vegetable soup with minced meat balls, cheese, sandwiches, hors d'oeuvre with eggs and roast beef, mossy pastries, wine and cigarettes, everything as much as you want (clandestinely).
Miep has had 10 drinks, is that the anti-alcoholic woman? If Miep already had so much on, how much would her ega have beaten inside? Of course, they were all a bit tipsy at that party. There were two officers from the police gang, who took pictures of the couple. It turns out that Miep cannot put her people in hiding out of her mind for a minute, because she immediately wrote down the name and address of these men, in case something should happen and good Dutch people are needed.
She made us so delicious, we who got nothing but two spoonfuls of porridge for our breakfast and who rattled with hunger, we get nothing but half raw spinach (for the vitamins) and rotten potatoes that day in and day out, we who beat in our hollow stomach nothing but lettuce, stew, spinach and more spinach. Maybe we'll be as strong as Popeye again, although I don't see much of it yet!
If Miep had taken us to the engagement, there would have been nothing left of the sandwiches for the other guests. I can tell you that we pulled the words out of Miep's mouth, that we stood around her, as if we had never heard of good food or fancy people in our lives!
And those are now the granddaughters of a millionaire. It's crazy in the world!
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 9 May, 1944
Dear Kitty,
The story of Ellen the fairy is finished. I transcribed it on beautiful stationery, decorated with red ink and sewn it together. The whole thing looks nice, but isn't it a bit little for father's birthday? I don't know. Margot and mother each made a birthday poem.
Mr Kraler came up this afternoon with the news that Mrs B., who used to work as a demonstrator in the business, wants to drink here in the office every afternoon at two o'clock next week. Imagine! No one can come up anymore, the potatoes can't be brought, Elli doesn't get food, we can't go to the W.C., we can't move, and so on and so forth.
We came up with the most diverse proposals for the day to brush her off. Van Daan thought that a good laxative in her kof e might be sufficient. 'No', replied Mr Koophuis, 'please don't, then she won't come out of the box at all!' Thunderous laughter. "From the box?" asked the lady, "What does that mean?" An explanation followed. "Can I always use that?" she asked very sillyly. 'Imagine,' Elli giggled, 'that you asked for the box in the Bijenkorf, they wouldn't even understand you!'
Oh Kit, it's such weather, if only I could go outside! Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
We were learning French in the attic yesterday afternoon, when I suddenly heard the clatter of water behind me. I asked Peter what that meant, but he didn't even answer, ran to the loft where the source of the mischief was and pushed Mouschi, who had taken a seat next to it with a heavy-handed gesture in the right place because of a too wet litter box. A loud spectacle followed and the now urinated Mouschi ran down.
Mouschi had sat down on a little sawdust to experience a little cat litter. The puddle immediately ran from the loft through the ceiling to the attic and unfortunately exactly in and next to the potato barrel.
The ceiling dripped and since the attic ground is in turn not free of holes, several yellow drops fell through the ceiling of the room, between a pile of stockings and a few books, which lay on the table. I was doubled over with laughter, it was also a crazy sight, the huddled Mouschi under a chair, Peter with water, bleach powder and mop and Van Daan appeasing. The mischief was soon restored, but it is a well-known fact that cat puddles smell terrible. The potatoes proved that all too clearly yesterday and also the wood waste, which father brought down in a bucket to burn. Poor Mouschi! Can you know that there is no peat mole available?
Your Anne.
P.S. Yesterday and tonight our beloved Queen spoke, she is taking a holiday to be able to return to the Netherlands strengthened. She spoke of 'soon when I am back, soon liberation, heroism and heavy burdens'.
A speech by Minister Gerbrandy followed. A pastor ended the evening with a prayer to God to take care of the Jews, the people in concentration camps, in prisons and in Germany.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
I'm terribly busy at the moment and as crazy as it sounds, I don't have enough time to get through my mountain of work. Shall I tell you briefly, what to do? Now then, until tomorrow, I have to read the first part of Galileo Galilei's life history, because it has to go back to the library. Yesterday I started it, but I can get it out.
Next week I have to read Palestine at the Crossroads and the second part of Galileo. Furthermore, yesterday I read the first part of the biography of Emperor Charles V and I urgently need to work out the many notes and family trees that I have extracted from it. I then extracted three pages of foreign words, all of which must be recited, written down and learned, from the various books. No four is that all my lm stars are mixed up in terrible disarray and crave a clean-up; however, since such a clean-up would take several days and Professor Anne is currently, as mentioned, suffocating in the work, the chaos is still left chaos.
Then Theseus, Oedipus, Peleus, Orpheus, Jason and Hercules wait for an order, since several of their deeds are intertwined like colourful threads in a dress in my head, myron and Phidias also have to undergo urgent treatment if they are not to get completely out of their context. Similarly, for example, the Seven- and Nine-Year War; I mix everything up that way. Yes, what do you have to start with such a memory! Imagine how forgetful I will be when I'm eighty!
Oh, the Bible, how long will it be before I meet the story of the bathing Suzanna? And what do they mean by the guilt of Sodom and Gomorrha? Oh there is still so much to ask and learn. And Liselotte von der Pfalz, who I have completely abandoned in the meantime.
Kitty, do you see that I'm overflowing?
Now about something else: You've known for a long time that my dearest wish is to become a journalist once and later a famous writer. Whether I will ever be able to carry out these greatness tendencies (or - madness?) remains to be seen, but I still have topics so far. After the war I want to publish at least a book entitled 'Het Achterhuis'. Whether that succeeds also remains the question, but my diary will be able to serve for that.
In addition to 'The Secret Annex', I have other topics in the pipeline. I will sometimes write to you about this in detail, if they have taken on solid form.
Your Anne.

Dearest Kitty,
Yesterday was father's birthday; father and mother had been married for 19 years, it was not a working day and the sun was shining, as she had never shone in 1944. Our chestnut tree is in full bloom from top to bottom, it is heavily laden with leaves and much more beautiful than last year.
Father has received a biography of Linnaeus' life from Koophuis, a book about nature from Kraler, from DusselAmsterdam in the water, from Van Daan a giant box made up as if by the best decorator with three eggs, an ash beer, an ash yogurt and a green tie in it. Our pot of syrup did stand out a bit. My roses smell wonderful in contrast to Miep and Elli's carnations, which are odorless but also very beautiful. He is spoiled. There are 50 cakes, delicious! Father himself treated on gingerbread, for the men's beer and for the ladies yogurt. Everything was appreciated.
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 16 May, 1944
Dearest Kitty,
As a change, because we haven't talked about it for so long, I want to tell you a little discussion that Mr. and Mrs. had last night. Madam: 'The Germans must have made the Atlantik-Wall very strong, they will certainly do everything in their power to stop the English.
It is enormous how much power the Germans have!' Sir: 'Oh yes, very much so'.
Madam: 'Yes-ah'.
Sir: 'Certainly the Germans will win the war at the end, that's how strong they are!'
Madam: 'That is quite possible, I am not yet convinced of the opposite'.
Sir: 'I won't answer anymore'.
Madam: 'You always answer me again, you let yourself get carried away again and again'.
Sir: 'Well, my answers are very minimal'.
Madam: 'But you answer anyway and you must always be right! Your predictions don't always come true!'
Sir: 'So far, my predictions have come true'.
Madam: "That's not true. The invasion was already there last year, the Finns already had peace, Italy was over in the winter, the Russians already had Lemberg, oh no, I don't care much about your predictions.'
Sir (standing up): "And finally keep your big mouth, I will prove you again, that I am right, one time you will get tired of it, I can no longer hear that cancer, with your nose I will push you into all your teasing!"
End of first act.
I actually had to laugh a lot, mother too and Peter was also baffled. Oh those stupid adults, let them start learning before they have so much to say about the children!
Your Anne.
Friday, 19 May, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Yesterday I was already very miserable, vomiting (and that Anne!), abdominal pain, all the trouble you can imagine. Today the weather is much better, I am very hungry, but from those kidney beans that we get today, I will prefer to stay away.
Peter and me are doing well, the poor boy needs some tenderness even more than I do. He still blushes every night at his night kiss and just begs for another one. Would I be the better replacement for Mof? I don't mind, he's already so happy, now that he knows someone loves him.
I am a bit above the situation after my difficult conquest, but you may not think that my love is narrowed. He is a treasure, but I soon closed my inner self again; if he wants to break the lock again, the crowbar must be harder!
Your Anne.
Saturday, 20 May, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Last night I came down from the attic, and immediately saw, when I entered the room, that the beautiful vase of carnations was on the floor, mother was mopping on her knees, while Margot fished my papers off the ground.
"What happened here?" I asked with anxious premonitions, and not even waiting for their answer, I watched the damage from a distance. My whole family tree folder, notebooks, books, everything was floating. I cried almost and was so excited that I can't remember anything about my words, but Margot said that I was saying something like 'unübersehbare Schaden, terrible, terrible, never to make up for it' and more. Father laughed, mother and Margot fell in, but I could cry for all that lost work and the well-worked-out notes.
On closer inspection, the 'unübersehbare Schaden' was fortunately not too bad, carefully I looked for the pasted papers together in the attic and loosened them. Then I hung them next to each other on the clotheslines to dry. It was a funny sight and I had to laugh again: Maria de Medici next to Charles the V, William of Orange and Marie Antoinette; that is 'Racial shaming', joked Mr Van Daan. After entrusting Peter with the care of my papers, I went back downstairs.
"Which books are spoiled?" I asked Margot, who was checking my book treasure. "Algebra," Margot said. I soon approached, but unfortunately the algebra book had not yet spoiled either. I wish that had fallen into the vase: I have never hated one book as much as that algebra book. In the front are at least 20 names of girls, who already had it in their possession before me, it is old, yellow, scribbled and improved. If I'm really wanton again, I'll tear that rot to pieces!
Your Anne.
Monday, 22 May 1944
Dear Kitty,
Father lost five of yoghurt to Mrs. Van Daan on 20 May with betting. The invasion really hasn't come yet; I can safely say that the whole of Amsterdam, the whole of the Netherlands, yes the whole west coast of Europe to Spain, speaks and debates about the invasion day and night, bets on it and ... Hopes.
The tension rises to the top. By no means all the people we count among the 'good' Dutch have kept their faith in the English, not all find the English bluff a masterful example, oh no, people finally want to see deeds, great and heroic deeds. No one thinks beyond his nose, no one thinks of the English fighting for themselves and their country, everyone thinks that they are obliged to save Holland as soon and as well as possible.
What obligations do the English have to us? How did the Dutch earn the generous help they so firmly expect? Oh no, the Dutch will still be very mistaken, the English, despite all their bluff, have certainly not been more bluffed than all the other countries and countries that are now occupied. The English will certainly not apologize to us, because, even if we were to reproach them for sleeping during the years when Germany was arming itself, we cannot deny that all the other countries, especially those bordering Germany, also slept. We will not get there with ostrich politics, England has that and the whole world has seen that and for that all the Allies must now make the least heavy sacrifices and England not the least.
No country will sacrifice its men for nothing and especially not for the interests of another, nor will England. The invasion, liberation and freedom will come once, but England and America will determine the time and not all the occupied territories together.
To our great sorrow and our great dismay, we have heard that the mood towards us Jews has changed among many people. We have heard that anti-Semitism has come into circles that did not think about it in the past. The eight of us have touched all of us deeply, very deeply. The cause of this Jew-hatred is understandable, sometimes even human, but not good. The Christians reproach the Jews for talking past the Germans, for betraying their helpers, for the jews to suffer the terrible fate and punishment of so many.
This is all true, but we must also look at the other side of the coin as in all things. Would the Christians in our place act differently? Can a person, indifferently a Jew or a Christian, remain silent for German means? Everyone knows that this is almost impossible, so why do they demand the impossible from the Jews?
It is murmured in underground circles that German Jews, who emigrated to the Netherlands and are now in Poland, will not be allowed to return to the Netherlands; they had asylrecht in the Netherlands, but when Hitler is gone, they will have to return to Germany.
When one hears that, one does not naturally ask oneself why this long and difficult war is being waged? Surely we always hear that we are all fighting together for freedom, truth and justice! And is there already starting to be discord during that fight, isn't the Jew less than the other? Oh it is sad, very sad, that for the umpteenth time the old wisdom has been confirmed: 'What one Christian does, he himself must justify, what one Jew does falls back on all Jews'.
Frankly, I cannot understand that the Dutch, people of this good, honest and righteous people, judge us so much, so judge the most oppressed, the unhappiest and the most pitiful of all peoples of the whole world perhaps.
I only hope for one thing, namely that this hatred of Jews will be transient, that the Dutch will still show who they are, that they will not and never waver in their sense of justice. Because anti-Semitism is unjust!
And if this terrible thing were indeed to become true, then the wretched remnant of Jews will leave the Netherlands. We too, we will continue with our bundle, from this beautiful country that has offered us such a warm shelter and is now turning our backs on us.
I love the Netherlands, I once hoped that it will serve me, patriotic, as a homeland, I still hope so!
Your Anne.
Thursday, 25 May, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Every day something different, this morning our greengrocer was caught, he had two Jews in the house. It is a heavy blow to us, not only that those poor Jews are on the brink of the abyss again, but for that man it is terrible.
The world is turned upside down here, the decent people are sent away to concentration camps, prisons and lonely cells and the scum rules over young and old, rich and poor. One flies in because of the black trade, the second by helping Jews or other people in hiding, nobody who is not at the N.S.B. knows what will happen tomorrow.
Also for us this man is a very heavy loss. The girls cannot and should not drag those portions of potatoes, the only thing on it is to eat less. How we will do it I will tell you, it certainly does not get more pleasant. Mother says that we do not get breakfast at all in the morning, porridge and bread in the afternoon, baked potatoes in the evening and possibly vegetables or lettuce once or twice a week, nothing more. That will be starvation, but all the hardships are not as bad as are discovered.
Your Anne.
Friday, 26 May, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Finally, finally, I am ready to sit quietly at my table in front of the crack of the window and you can write everything, everything.
I feel as miserable as hasn't been the case in months, not even after the break-in I was so broken inside and out. On the one hand the greengrocer, the Jewish question, which is discussed at length throughout the house, the lack of invasion, the bad food, the tension, the miserable mood, the disappointment for Peter and on the other hand, Elli's engagement, Pinksterreception, flowers, Kraler's birthday, cakes and stories of cabarets, lms and concerts. That difference, that big difference, that is always there, one day we laugh at the humorousness of our hiding situation, but the other day and many more days we are afraid and fear, tension and despair are reading on our faces.
Miep and Kraler experience the most the burden of the eight of us, Miep in her work, Kraler, who sometimes becomes too powerful in the colossal responsibility and who can hardly speak of restrained nerves and excitement. Koophuis and Elli also take good care of us, very well even, but once for them the Secret Annex is also forgotten, even if it is only for a few hours, a day, two days maybe. They have their own worries, Koophuis for his health, Elli for her engagement which doesn't look very rosy and in addition to those worries they also have their trips, their visits, their whole lives of ordinary people. For them the tension sometimes recedes, even if only for a short time, for us it never gives way. It has been going on for two years now, and how long will we have to continue to resist this almost unbearable, ever-growing pressure?
The sewerage system is clogged, no water may be opened or only drop by drop, we may not go to the W.C. or have to bring a brush, the dirty water we store in a large Cologne pot. For today we can help ourselves, but what to do if the plumber can not do it alone? The city cleaning service does not come before Tuesday.
Miep sent us a currant mik with the inscription 'Merry Pentecost'. It is almost as if she is mocking, our mood and our fear are not 'happy'. We have all become more afraid after the affair with the greengrocer, you hear from all sides again. sst.', everything happens softer. The police forced the door there, so we are not safe for that either! If we too ... no, I am not allowed to write it down, but the question cannot be pushed away today, on the contrary, all the fear once experienced is before me again in all its horror.
I only had to go down to the W.C. at eight o'clock tonight, no one was downstairs, all were on the radio, I wanted to be brave, but it was difficult. I still feel safer up here than just downstairs in that big, quiet house; only with the mysterious, stompy sounds from above and the honking of the horns on the street. I tremble when I don't move on and think about the situation.
I always wonder if it would not have been better for all of us if we had not gone into hiding, if we were now dead and did not experience this misery, especially because then our protectors would no longer be in danger. But even for that thought we all shy away, we still love life, we have not yet forgotten the voice of nature, we still hope, hope for everything. Let something happen soon, if necessary shoot, that can not crush us more than this unrest does. Let the end come, even if it is hard, at least we will know whether we will eventually overcome or perish.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 31 May, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Such a beautiful, warm, one can safely say hot Pentecost it has rarely been. Heat is terrible here in the Secret Annex; to give you an impression of the many complaints, I will briefly describe the hot days:
Saturday: 'Lovely, what a weather', we all said in the morning. 'If only it were a little less hot', in the afternoon when the windows had to be closed.
Sunday: 'It's not to last, that heat. The butter melts, there is no cool spot in the house, the bread becomes dry, the milk spoils, no window can open, we poor outcasts are suffocating here, while the other people have Pentecost vacancy.'
Monday: "My feet hurt me. I don't have thin clothes. I can't wash dishes in that heat', says mrs. It was huge.
I still can't stand heat and am happy that today the wind blows quite a bit and the sun is shining anyway.
Your Anne.
Monday, 5 June, 1944
Dear Kitty,
New Secret Annex troubles, quarrel between Dussel and Franks about something very unimportant: the butter distribution. Capitulation of Dussel. Thick friendship between Mrs. Van Daan and the latter, irt parties, kisses and friendly laughs. Dussel begins to get women's desires.
Captured of Rome by the Fifth Army, the city has neither been destroyed nor bombed.
Few vegetables and potatoes. Bad again. Sustained heavy bombing of Pas de Calais and French coast.
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 6 June, 1944
Dearest Kitty,
'This is D.-day', said the English radio at 12 o'clock and rightly so, 'This is the day', the invasion has begun!
This morning at eight o'clock the English reported: heavy bombardment of Calais, Boulogne, Le Hâvre and Cherbourg, as well as Pas de Calais (As usual). Furthermore, a security measure for the occupied territories, all people living in the zone of 35 km from the coast, must prepare for bombing. If possible, the English will eject pamphlets an hour in advance.
According to German reports, English parachute troops have landed on the French coast. English landing boats in battle with German marines, according to the B.B.C.
Discussion in the Secret Annex at nine o'clock at breakfast: Is this a proe anding just like two years ago at Dieppe?
English broadcast in German, Dutch, French and other languages at 10 am: 'The invasion has begun!' So: the 'real' invasion. English broadcast in German 11 a.m.: Speech by Commander-in-Chief General Dwight Eisenhower.
English broadcast in English 12 o'clock: 'This is D.-day'. General Eisenhower said to the French people: 'Stiff ghting will come now, but after this the victory. The year 1944 is the year of complete victory, good luck!'
English broadcast in English one hour (translated):
11,000 planes are ready and fly incessantly off and on to lower troops and bomb behind the lines. 4000 landing craft plus small boats bring troops and equipment ashore between Cherbourg and Le Hâvre incessantly. British and American troops are already engaged in hard fighting. Speeches by Gerbrandy, the Prime Minister of Belgium, King Haakon of Norway, de Gaulle for France, the King of England, not to mention Churchill.
The Secret Annex in turmoil! Would the long-awaited liberation really approach, the liberation that has been talked about so much, but which is still beautiful, the fairytale-like to ever become a reality? Would this year, 1944, give us victory? We don't know it yet, but hope revives us, makes us brave again, makes us strong again. For courageously we must endure the many fears, the hardships and the suffering, now it is important to remain calm and steadfast. Now more than ever, it is important to press the nails into the flesh and not to scream. France, Russia, Italy and Germany can scream with misery, but we do not yet have the right to do so!
Oh Kitty, the best thing about that invasion is that I feel like friends are coming. Those terrible Germans have oppressed us for so long and put the knife to our throats that the thoughts of friends and rescue inspires us with confidence!
Now it no longer applies to the Jews, now it applies to the Netherlands and the whole of occupied Europe. Maybe, says Margot, I can still go to school in September or October.
Your Anne.
P.S. I will keep you posted on the latest posts!
Friday, 9 June, 1944
Dear Kitty,
With the invasion, it's fine-fine. The Allies have taken Bayeux, a village on the French coast and are now fighting for Caen. It is clear that the intention is to cut off the peninsula on which Cherbourg is located. Every evening war correspondents tell of the difficulties, courage and enthusiasm of the army; they knew how to tell the most incredible feats. Also wounded, who are now back in England, were in front of the microphone. Despite the miserable weather, they fly diligently. It has come to our attention through the B.B.C. that Churchill wanted to experience the invasion with the troops, only on the advice of Eisenhower and other Generals this plan did not go through. Think of what courage from such an old man, he is certainly already 70 years old.
Here the excitement has calmed down a bit, but we hope that the war will finally be over by the end of the year. It's about time! Mrs. Van Daan's whining is not to be heard, now that she can no longer drive us crazy with the invasion, she complains all day about the bad weather. You would feel like putting her in a bucket of cold water on the loft.
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 13 June, 1944
Dear Kitty,
My birthday is over, so now I'm 15. I got quite a lot. The five volumes Springer Art History, a pair of underwear, two belts, a handkerchief, two ashes of yogurt, a jar of jam, a gingerbread, a botany book by father and mother. Doublé bracelet by Margot, Patria book by the Van Daans, biomals and lathyrus by Dussel, sweets and notebooks by Miep and Elli and the highlight: the book Maria Theresia and three slices of full-fat cheese by Kraler. From Peter a bunch of peonies, the poor boy has given himself so much trouble to find something, but nothing has succeeded.
The invasion is still going very well, despite the miserable weather, the countless storms, pouring showers and high seas.
Churchill, Smuts, Eisenhower and Arnold were yesterday in the French villages, which were conquered and liberated by the English. Churchill was on a torpedo boat that shelled the coast. That man, like so many men, seems to know no fear, enviable!
The mood in the Netherlands cannot be gauged from our Achterfort. No doubt the people are happy that the idle (!) England finally roll up their sleeves themselves. All the Dutch who still look down on the English, taunt England and the old gentlemen government, call english cowardly, but still hate the Germans, should be shaken up as much as it happens with a pillow. Maybe that confused brain will then settle in a somewhat better fold.
Your Anne.
Wednesday, 14 June, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Many wishes, many thoughts, many accusations and many reproaches haunt my mind. I am not full of imagination, as many people believe, I know my countless mistakes and flaws better than anyone else, only with the difference that I also know that I also want to improve, will improve and have already improved a lot.
How is it, I often wonder, that everyone still finds me so incredibly stubborn and indiscreet? Am I that stubborn? Is it really me, or maybe it's not the others too? That sounds crazy, I notice it, but I don't cross out my last sentence, because it's not that crazy. Mrs. Van Daan, one of my main accusers, is known as unintelligent and let me just say 'stupid'. Stupid people usually can't stomach it when others do something better than themselves.
She thinks I am stupid, because I do not fall short in understanding to the extent that she herself, she finds me indiscreet, because she is even worse, she thinks my dresses are too short, because hers are even shorter. And that is why she also finds me stubborn, because she herself still talks twice as much as I do about subjects of which she has no knowledge at all. But one of my most beloved sayings is: 'Something is true of every reproach', and I readily admit that I am stubborn.
Now the tricky thing about my nature is that I don't get as many positions and as much criticism from anyone as I do from myself. When mother adds her portion of advice, the hope of preaching becomes so insurmountable that I despair of ever coming out of it, become brutal and contradict and then the well-known and already so old Anne word comes back: 'Nobody understands me either!'
This word is in me and no matter how untrue it may seem, there is also a hint of truth in this. My self-accusations often reach such a magnitude that I long for a comforting voice, which brings them back into healthy forms and also attracts something from my inner room, but unfortunately, I can search for a long time, it has not yet been found.
I know you're thinking of Peter now, huh Kit? It is so, Peter loves me, not as a lover but as a friend, his affection increases by the day, but what that mysterious is, that holds us both back, I do not understand that myself. Sometimes I think that that terrible longing of mine for him was exaggerated, but that is not the case, because if I was not upstairs for two days, I long for him again as much as never before. Peter is sweet and good, yet I cannot deny that much in him disappoints me. I especially don't like his religious aversion, eating conversations and more such diverse things. Nevertheless, I am firmly convinced that according to our honest agreement we will never get into a fight, Peet is peace-loving, tolerant and very conceding. He allows himself to say many more things by me than he allows his mother, he tries with great tenacity to keep his affairs in order. But still, why does his insides stay inside and I am never allowed to touch it? He is a much more closed nature than I am, that is true, but I know - and now really from practice - that even the most closed natures in their time just as hard or even harder for a familiar desire.
Peter and I have both spent our thinking years in the Secret Annex, we often talk about future, past and present, but as I said, I miss the real thing and yet I am sure it is there.
Your Anne.
Thursday, 15 June, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Could it be because I couldn't stick my nose in the open air for so long that I became so fond of everything that is nature? I remember very well that a bright blue sky, squeaking birds, moonshine and blooming flowers could not hold my attention in the past. Here it has changed.
For example, at Pentecost, when it was so hot, I forcibly kept my eyes open in the evening, to be able to look at the moon at the open window once and only once. Unfortunately, this sacrifice came to nothing, as the moon scattered too much light and I was not allowed to risk an open window. Another time, already many months ago, I happened to be upstairs, when the window was open in the evening. I didn't go down before the air time was over. The dark rainy evening, the storm, the chasing clouds held me captive in their power; after a year and a half I had seen the night face to face for the first time. After that night, my desire to see this again was greater than my fear of thieves, dark rat house or robberies. I went down all by myself and looked out the window of the private office and kitchen. Many people find nature beautiful, many sleep under the open sky, many long in prisons or hospitals for the day when they can enjoy nature freely again, but few are so closed off and isolated with their desire from that which is the same for rich and poor.
It is not an imagination that seeing the sky, the clouds, the moon and the stars makes me calm and waiting. This remedy is much better than valerian or bromine, nature makes me humble and ready to bravely absorb all the blows.
Unfortunately, it has had to be the case that I can see nature - and only exceptionally - through thickly pollinated and dirty curtained windows. And to look through it is no longer a pleasure, because nature is the only thing that really cannot tolerate a surrogate.
Your Anne.
Friday, 16 June, 1944
Dear Kitty,
New problems: madam is desperate, speaks of a bullet through the head, prison, hanging and suicide. She is jealous that Peter does and does not trust me. She is offended that Dussel does not sufficiently address her iriders, afraid that her husband will smoke all the fur coat money, quarrels, scolds, cries, complains, laughs and then starts arguing again.
What should you do with such a snotting and moldy copy? She is not taken seriously by anyone, she has no character, she complains to everyone and she walks around as: von hinten Lyceum, von vorne Museum. In addition, the worst thing is that Peter becomes brutal, Mr. Van Daan irritable and mother cynical. Yes, that's a condition for me! There is only one rule to keep in mind: laugh at everything and don't bother others! It seems selfish, it is in reality the only medicine for those who need to find comfort in themselves.
Kraler has another call to dig for four weeks.
He tries to be released by a doctor's certificate and a letter from the case.
Koophuis wants to undergo stomach surgery. Yesterday at 11 o'clock the phone of all private individuals was cut off.
Your Anne.
Friday, 23 June, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Nothing special going on here. The English have started the big attack on Cherbourg, according to Pim and Van Daan we are certainly free on 10 October! The Russians are taking part in the action, yesterday their offensive at Witebsk started, which is exactly on the day three years after the German invasion.
We hardly have any potatoes, in the future we want to count down the potatoes for all eight, then everyone can see what he is doing.
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 27 June, 1944
Dearest Kitty,
The mood has changed, it is going very well. Cherbourg, Witebsk and Slobin fell today. Lots of loot and prisoners. Now the English can land whatever they want, because they have a port, the whole Cotentin, three weeks after the Invasion English! Great achievement. In the three weeks since D. Day, not a day has been without rain and storm, both here and in France, but that bad luck does not prevent the English and Americans from showing their enormous strength and how to show! The Wuwa (miracle weapon) is in full action, but what does such a sisser mean other than some damage in England and full newspapers at the muffles? By the way, if they notice in that Moffrika that the 'Bolshevik danger' is really approaching, they will get even more shivering.
All German women and children who do not work for the Weermacht are evacuated from the coastal regions to Groningen, Friesland and Gelderland. Mussert has stated that when the invasion comes here, he puts on a soldier's suit. Does the fat man want to fight? Could he have done it earlier in Russia. Finland refused the peace offer at the time, even now the negotiations on this have broken down again, how they will repent, those stupid people!
How far do you think we are on July 27th? Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
Bad weather or: bad weather at a stretch to the 30th of June.
Isn't that neat, oh sure, I can already speak a little English; to prove that I read: An ideal husband with dictionary. War excellent! Bobroisk, Mogilef and Orsha fallen, many prisoners.
Here everything allright, moods move forward. Our hyperoptimists triumph. Elli has changed her hairstyle, Miep has a week off. That's the latest news.
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
It scares me when Peter speaks of it, that he might later
become or will speculate as a criminal; although it is of course meant as a joke, I still have the feeling that he himself is afraid of his character weakness. Again and again I hear, both from Margot and Peter: 'Yes, if I was as strong and courageous as you, if I persevered so precisely my will, if I had such a persistent energy, yes then ...!'
Is it really a good quality that I don't let myself be influenced? Is it a good thing that I follow almost exclusively the way of my own conscience?
Honestly, I can't imagine how someone can say, "I'm weak," and then remain weak. If one already knows such a thing, why not work against it, why not train his character? The answer was, "Because it's so much easier!" That answer made me a little discouraged. Easy? Does a lazy and deceitful life mean that it is also an easy life? Oh no, it can't be true, it can't be, that limpness and ... money can seduce someone so quickly.
I have thought for a long time about what to give for an answer, how to get Peet to believe in himself and especially to improve himself; whether my train of thought is correct, I don't know.
I have so often imagined what it would be like if someone gave me his trust, but now, when the time has come, I see how difficult it is to think completely with the thought of that other person and then find the answer. Especially because "easy" and "money" understanding is something completely foreign and new to me. Peter starts to lean on me a bit and that is not allowed under any circumstances. Standing on your own two feet in life is difficult for a type like Peter, but it is even more difficult to stand on your own two feet, as a conscious living human being. Because if you are, it is doubly difficult to find your way through the sea of problems and still remain steadfast. I just kind of float around, searching for days, looking for a completely adequate remedy against the terrible word: 'easy'.
How can I make it clear to him that what seems so easy and beautiful will draw him to the depths, the depths where there are no friends, no support and nothing beautiful anymore, the depth from which getting up is almost impossible?
We all live, but do not know why and for what, we all live for the purpose of becoming happy, we all live differently and yet equal. The three of us were raised in a good circle, we can learn, we have the opportunity to achieve something, we have many reasons to hope for a good happiness, but ... we have to earn it ourselves. And that is what can never be achieved with anything easy. Earning happiness means working and doing good and not speculating and being lazy. Laziness may seem attractive, working gives satisfaction.
I can't understand people who don't like working, but that's not the case with Peter either; he just doesn't have a fixed goal in mind, thinks he's too stupid and too minus to perform anything. Poor boy, he has never known the feeling of making others happy and I can't teach him that either. He has no religion, speaks mockingly of Jesus Christ, curses with the name of God; although I'm not orthodox either, it hurts me every time I notice how abandoned, how contemptuous, how poor he is.
People who have a religion should be happy, because it is not every given to believe otherworldly things. It is not even necessary to be afraid of punishments after death; purgatory, hell, and heaven are things that many cannot accept, yet some religion, which it is matters, keeps man on the right path. It is not a fear of God, but the highness of one's own honor and conscience. How beautiful and good all people would be if every night before falling asleep they would recall the events of the whole day and then look at exactly what has been good and bad in their own performance. Involuntarily you try to improve every day from the beginning, probably that you will achieve a lot over time. This remedy can be used for everyone, it costs nothing and is definitely very useful. Because those who do not know must learn and experience it: 'A calm conscience makes strong!'
Your Anne.

Dear Kitty,
The main representative of the business, Mr B., was in Beverwijk and received strawberries from the auction. They arrived here, dust g, full of sand, but to a large extent. No less than 24 boxes for the office and us. Immediately in the evening, the first six glasses were wecked and eight jars of jam were made. The next morning Miep wanted to cook jam for office.
At half past one no strangers in the house, outside door locked, boxes picked up, Peter, father, Van Daan, stomping on the stairs: Anne hot water from the geyser tap, Margot bucket, all hands on deck! With a very strange feeling in my stomach, I stepped into the crowded office kitchen. Miep, Elli, Koophuis, Henk, father, Peter: people in hiding and feeding column, all mixed up and that in the middle of the day!
Through the curtains one can not look inside, but loud talk, slamming doors, I got the shivering of excitement. Yes, but are we really still in hiding, did it go through me, you have to have such a feeling, if you can show yourself to the world again. The pan was full, quickly upstairs. In our kitchen at the table, the rest of the family stood and picked, at least it had to represent picking; more went into the mouths than into the buckets. Another bucket was soon needed, Peter went back downstairs to the kitchen - there were two calls; the bucket remained standing, Peter held upstairs, the cupboard door locked! We were impatient, the tap had to stay closed and even though the half-washed strawberries were still waiting for their bath, the diving rule: 'Someone in the house, all taps closed for the noise that the water supply makes', was maintained.
At one o'clock Henk comes with the announcement, it was the postman. Peter rushes down the stairs again. Rank, the bell, turns right. I'm going to listen if someone comes, first at the closet door, then gently at the top of the stairs. Finally, Peter and I hang over the handrail like two thieves and listen to the noise coming from below. Not a strange voice, Peter secretly goes down the stairs, stands halfway and shouts: 'Elli!' No answer, again: 'Elli!' The noise in the kitchen is louder than Peter's voice. He went down the stairs, into the kitchen. I'm tensely looking down: 'Make sure you come up, Peter, the accountant is there, you have to leave!' It is the voice of Koophuis. Sighing, Peter comes upstairs, the closet door closes. Half past two, Kraler finally arrives. 'Oh my gosh, I see nothing more than strawberries, my breakfast strawberries, Henk eats strawberries, Koophuis sweets strawberries, Miep cooks strawberries, I smell strawberries, I want to get rid of that red stuff and go upstairs, then we will be washed here ... strawberries'.
The rest of the strawberries go into the weck. In the evening: two pots open. Father quickly turns it into jam. The next morning: two weck glasses open, in the afternoon four weck glasses open, Van Daan had not sterilized them hot enough. Now dad cooks jam every night.
We eat porridge with strawberries, buttermilk with strawberries, sandwich with strawberries, strawberries for dessert, strawberries with sugar, strawberries with sand. For two days strawberries, strawberries, strawberries, strawberries danced everywhere, then the stock was at or under lock and key in the pots.
'Hear me out, Anne', Margot shouts, 'we got dips from the greengrocer around the corner, 19 pounds'. "That's nice of him," I reply. Indeed it is nice, but the work ... Pooh!
"You all have to participate on Saturday morning," mother announces at the table. And really, this morning after breakfast the large enamel pan appeared on the table, filled to the brim with doppers. The cap is a tedious job, but then you have to try the 'peeling out'. I think most people don't know how nice and soft the pea pod tastes when the inner skin is removed. However, the benefits just mentioned do not yet make it to the great advantage, that the portion that can be eaten is three times as large as if you only eat the peas.
Pulling this sheet is an extraordinarily precise and fussy job, which may well be suitable for pedantic dentists or precise office workers; for an impatient fry fish like me it's terrible. At half past ten we started, at half past eleven I get up, at half past twelve I sit down again. It buzzes in my ears: nodding corner, pulling skin, pulling a thread, throwing pods and so on and so on, it turns in front of my eyes, green, green, worm, thread, rotten pod, green, green, green.
From lameness to do something, I chat all morning all morning all the nonsense that exists, make them all laugh and feel myself almost perish from stupidity. With every thread I pull, I know better that I never, ever want to be just a housewife!
At 12 o'clock we finally have breakfast, but from half past one to a quarter past one we have to pull sheets again. I'm pretty much seasick when I stop, the others a bit too. I go to sleep until four o'clock and then I'm still confused by those miserable peas.
Your Anne.
Saturday, 15 July, 1944
Dear Kitty,
We had a book from the library with the challenging title: How do you find the modern young girl? I would like to talk about this subject today.
The author of the book criticizes 'the youth of today' from head to toe, without, however, completely rejecting everything that is young as: capable of nothing good. On the contrary, it is of the opinion that if the youth wanted to, they could build a great, more beautiful and better world, that the youth has the means, but is concerned with superficial things without giving the essentially beautiful a look.
With some passages I had the strong feeling that the writer meant me with her disapprovals and that is why I finally want to open myself completely to you and defend myself against this attack. I have a strong character trait that everyone who has known me for a longer period of time should notice, namely my self-knowledge. I can look at myself in all my actions, as if I were a stranger. Not at all biased or with a bag of apologies, I then face the Anne of every day and watch what she does well and what she does badly. That 'sense of self' never lets me go and with every word I utter I immediately know when it is pronounced: 'This should have been different', or 'That is good as it is'. I condemn myself in so many untold things and see more and more how true that word of father was: 'Every child must raise himself'. Parents can only give advice or good directions, the final formation of a person's character is in his own hands.
In addition, I have an extraordinary courage in life, I always feel so strong and capable of carrying, so free and so young! When I first noticed this, I was happy, because I do not believe that I will soon bow to the blows that everyone has to absorb.
But I've talked about those things so many times, I wanted to get to the chapter 'father and mother don't understand me'. My father and mother have always spoiled me, were kind to me, defended me and did whatever parents can do. And yet for a long time I have felt so incredibly lonely, excluded, neglected and misunderstood. Father tried everything possible to temper my rebellion, it did not help, I myself healed myself by telling myself the wrong thing about my actions.
How is it that father has never supported me in my struggle, that he completely missed out when he wanted to offer me a helping hand? Father has dealt with the wrong means, he has always spoken to me as a child, who had to go through difficult childhoods. That sounds crazy, because no one but father has always given me a lot of trust and no one other than father has made me feel that I am wise. But one thing he neglected: he didn't think about the fact that my fight to get on top of it was more important to me than anything else. I didn't want to hear about 'age phenomena', 'other girls', 'goes away by itself', I didn't want to be treated as a girl-like-everyone-else, but as Anne-in-her-own. Pim didn't understand that. Besides, I can't give someone my trust, who doesn't tell me a lot about himself either, and because I know very little about Pim, I won't be able to enter the road to the intimate between us.
Pim always takes the position of the elderly father, who has also had such transient tendencies, but who can no longer sympathize with me as a friend, no matter how diligently he searches for it.
Because of these things I have come to never share my worldviews and my well-thought-out theories to anyone other than my diary and occasionally to Margot. From father I hid everything that touched myself: I never let him share in my ideals, I knowingly alienated him from me.
I could not do otherwise, I acted completely according to my feelings, but I acted, as it was good for my rest. Because I would lose my peace and self-confidence, which I have built up so shakily, if I had to endure criticism of my half-affe work now. And I don't even have that for Pim, no matter how loud it may sound, because not only have I not let Pim share anything in my inner life, I often push him even further away from me because of my irritability.
This is a point about which I think a lot: how is it that Pim annoys me so much? That I can hardly learn with him, that his caresses seem made to me, that I want to have peace and prefer to see, that he left me a little, until I am more confident in front of him again? Because the reproach still gnaws at me of that mean letter, which I dared to write to it in my excitement. Oh, how hard it is to really be strong and courageous on all sides!
Yet this did not give me my worst disappointment, no, much more than about father I think about Peter. I know very well that I conquered him instead of the other way around: I created a dream image of him, saw him as a still, sensitive, sweet boy, who so needs love and friendship. I had to speak out to a living one, I wanted to have a friend who helped me get back on my way, I accomplished the difficult work and slowly but surely turned it towards me. When I finally brought him to friendly feelings for me, we naturally came to intimacies, which now seem unheard of to me on closer inspection.
We talked about the most hidden things, but about the things that my heart was and is full of, we have remained silent until now. I still can't figure peter out, is he superficial, or is it shyness that even holds him back in front of me? But that aside, I made one mistake by eliminating all other possibilities for friendship and by trying to get closer to him with intimacies. He craves love and he starts to like me every day, I notice that very well. Our encounters satisfy him, with me they only work out the urge to try again and again with him. And yet I cannot get around to touching on the subjects that I would love to bring to light. I have brought Peter, more than he himself knows, to me by force. Now he is holding on to me and I do not see any sufficient means to separate him from me again and put him on my own feet. When I soon realized that he could not be a friend of my understanding, I strived to at least lift him out of his narrow-mindedness and to make him great in his youth.
'For in its deepest soil, youth is lonelier than old age'. This saying has stayed with me from some book and I have found it true.
Is it true, then, that the adults have a harder time here than the youth? No, that is certainly not true. Older people have an opinion about everything and no longer waver in their actions through life. We young people have double difficulty in maintaining our opinions at a time when all idealism is mentioned and crushed, where people show their ugliest side, where truth and justice and God are doubted.
Someone who still claims that the elderly have a much harder time here in the Secret Annex, certainly does not realize how much bigger the problems are coming our way, the problems for which we may still be far too young, but which impose themselves on us for so long, until after a very long time we think we have found a solution,  a solution usually that does not seem to be resistant to the facts, which in turn nullify it. That is the difficult thing in this day and age: ideals, dreams, beautiful expectations do not yet occur to us or they are hit by the horrific reality and thus completely destroyed.
It is a great miracle that I have not given up all my expectations, because they seem absurd and unworkable. Yet I hold them, in spite of everything, because I still believe in the inner goodness of man. It is completely impossible for me to build everything on the basis of death, misery and confusion. I see how the world is slowly being transformed more and more into a desert, I hear louder and louder the rolling thunder, which will also kill us, I feel the suffering of millions of people and yet, when I look at the sky, I think that everything will turn for the better again, that this hardness will also cease,  that there will be peace and tranquility in the world order again.
In the meantime I have to keep my ideas high and dry, in the times to come they may still be possible to carry them out.
Your Anne.
Friday, 21 July, 1944
Dear Kitty,
Now I'm getting hopeful, now finally it's going well. Yes, it's going well!
Bang messages! There was an assassination attempt on Hitler and sometimes not by Jewish communists or English capitalists, but by a noble Germanic German general, who is count and moreover still young. Divine providence saved the Fuehrer's life, and unfortunately he came off with a few scrapes and some burns. A few or more and generals close to him have been killed or wounded. The main perpetrator has been shot.
Surely the best proof is that there are many or more and generals who have the pé to the war and liked to see Hitler descend into the deepest vaults. Their aim is to establish a military dictatorship after Hitler's death, to make peace with the Allies by means of it, to arm themselves again and to start a war again after twenty years. Perhaps providence deliberately acted a bit to get it out of the way, because it is much easier and also more advantageous for the Allies if the immaculate Germans beat each other to death; the less work remains for the Russians and English and the sooner they can start building their own cities again.
But we are not there yet, and I do not want to prejudge the glorious facts at all. Yet you do notice that what I am saying now is sober reality, which has both feet on the ground; exceptionally, I am not talking about higher ideals. Hitler was also kind enough to inform his loyal and affectionate people that from today all soldiers have to obey the Gestapo and that any soldier who knows that his superior has been involved in this cowardly and inferior attack may shoot them without trial.
That will be beautiful history. Pietje Wijs has sore feet from the long walk, his boss the or cier snarls him off. Pietje grabs his gun, shouts: 'You wanted to kill the Fuehrer, there is your wages!' A bang and the haughty chef, who has dared to give Pietje positions, has entered eternal life (or is it eternal death?). In the end, it will look like the gentlemen or cieren their pants will meet with fear when they encounter a soldier or have to lead somewhere, because the soldiers will dare to say and do more than they do. Do you get it a little bit, or have I been choppy again? I can't help it, I'm far too happy to be logical, at the prospect that I could be in school again with October! Oh lala, didn't I just tell you that I don't want to be premature? Forgive me, I have the name of being a bundle of contradictions for a reason!
Your Anne.
Tuesday, 1 August, 1944
Dear Kitty,
'A bundle of contradictions' is the last sentence of my previous letter and the first of my current one. 'A bundle of contradictions', can you explain to me exactly what that is? What does contradiction mean? Like so many words, it has two meanings, contradiction from the outside and contradiction from the inside.
The first is the ordinary 'not resigning oneself to other people's opinions, knowing better, having the last word', and n, all unpleasant qualities for which I am known. The second thing, I'm not known for, that's my own secret.
I have already told you before, that my soul is, as it were, split in two. One side houses my exuberant cheerfulness, mockery for everything, my zest for life and especially the understanding of the light side of everything. By that I don't mean taking offense to irts, a kiss, a hug, a silly joke. This side usually lurks, displacing the other, which is much more beautiful, pure and deeper. Not true, nobody knows the beautiful side of Anne and that is why so few people can suffer me.
Certainly, I am an amusing clown for one afternoon, then everyone has enough of me for a month. Actually exactly the same thing that a love lm for deep-thinking people is, simply an a eiding, entertainment for once, something to forget, not bad but even less good. It's very sad for me to have to tell you this, but why shouldn't I do it, if I know it's the truth? My lighter superficial side will always finish the deeper side too quickly and therefore always overcome. You can't imagine how many times I haven't tried to push away this Anne, who is only half of everything Anne's name, to paralyze, to hide: it's not possible and I know why it's not.
I am very afraid that all who know me as I always am will discover that I have a different side, a more beautiful and better side. I'm afraid they'll scoff at me, find me ridiculous and sentimental, don't take me seriously. I am used to not being taken seriously, but only the 'light' Anne is used to it and can tolerate it, the 'heavier' is too weak for that. If I have really put the good Anne in the spotlight for fifteen minutes, then she pulls herself together like a herb of stir-me-not, as soon as she has to speak, Anne no. 1 speaks and, before I know it, disappears.
In company, the sweet Anne has never, not once, appeared, but in being alone she almost always predominates. I know exactly how I would like to be, no matter how I am... inside, but unfortunately, it's just me for myself. And that is perhaps, no, most certainly the reason why I call myself a happy indoor nature and other people consider me a happy outdoor nature. On the inside, the pure Anne shows me the way, on the outside I am nothing but a goat torn free from exuberance.
Like I said, I feel everything differently than I pronounce it and that's why I got the name of boy afterrunster, irt, wise nose and novelist. The cheerful Anne laughs about it, gives cheeky answers, shrugs her shoulders indifferently, pretends she doesn't care, but oh woe, exactly the opposite the silent Anne reacts. If I'm completely honest, I want to confess to you that I do care, that I make an untold effort to become different, but that I keep fighting against stronger armies.
It sobs in me: 'You see, that's what happened to you: bad opinions, mocking and disturbed faces, people who find you antipathetic and all because you don't listen to the good advice of your own good half. Ah, I would like to listen, but it is not possible; if I'm quiet and serious, everyone thinks it's a new comedy, and then I have to get out of it with a joke, not to mention my own family, who definitely think I'm sick, make me take headache pills and nerve tablets, feel my neck and forehead if I have a fever,  asks about my stool and criticizes my bad mood. I can't keep that up: when I'm looked after like that, I first get snibby, then sad, and finally I turn my heart around again, turn the bad out, the good inwards, and all the time look for a means to become, as I would so much like to be and as I could be,  if... there would be one other people living in the world.
Your Anne.
